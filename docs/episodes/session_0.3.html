<blockquote class="bluetext">
  <p>Welcome back, faithful reader!</p>

  <p>My many and profuse apologies for the lateness of this recap, I had many and varied things to do that demanded my attention. It’s all sorted now, though, so: Full Speed ahead! Atomic Batteries to power! Turbines to Speed!</p>

  <p>I have spoken about the design of the Consilium earlier in the thread, and Aurora has now been well and truly foreshadowed what with that art. What I haven’t said (I think) is that the same pressures delaying this recap prevented me from doing any prep for this session <em>beyond</em> those initial notes, so I winged it. The plot details were easy - it was the Shadow names that were difficult. Most of the storyteller characters in this session were named after five minutes of going “um” a lot. Cobra, the Free Councillor, is named after a brand of lager. Chris had a bottle on the shelf in my eye line, you see, and…</p>

  <p>Yeah. We’re lucky no one ended up being named “Fried Rice”.</p>

  <p>The fore- and aft- of the plot is now getting closer together, this being made up of the sixth and fourth sections of six. In the words of GlaDOS, these points of data now make a (mostly) beautiful line. Now, then, where were we?</p>
</blockquote>

<p><b>Now</b></p>

<p>The three mages look around the wreckage of the train carraige, littered with corpses.</p>

<p>Samael hangs up his mobile.</p>

<p>“He said he was on his way” - Samael</p>

<p>“We’d better get our story straight” - Cobalt, looking over the no-longer active Zombies.</p>

<p>He crouches</p>

<blockquote class="bluetext">
  <p>The astute will have noticed we’ve not technically followed on exactly - the last line of session 0.2 hasn’t happened yet</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Cobalt casts <i>Forensic Gaze</i>, trying to discover how the Zombies originally died. He seems surprised by the results.</p>

<p>“He did something to the air” (looking around) “the Moros. They were poisoned” - Cobalt</p>

<p>Samael wipes rapidly-evaporating ectoplasm from his coat.</p>

<p>“Good thing you checked. I wouldn’t have figured that out” - Samael</p>

<p>Persephone unstrings her bow and retrieves arrows.</p>

<p>After about fifteen minutes, there’s a flash of bright light that turns into a <i>Portal</i>, being cut into the air by a Roman Gladius wielded by a man that gives Samael the run in athletic blond stakes.</p>

<p>Excalibur, Sentinel of the Consilium, steps through his Portol and sheathes his Path Tool. The Portal seals itself behind him as he surveys the bodies.</p>

<p>“What the hell did you people DO here?!” - Excalibur</p>

<blockquote class="bluetext">
  <p>THERE we go <img class="emoji" title=":grinning:" alt=":grinning:" src="https://github.githubassets.com/images/icons/emoji/unicode/1f600.png" height="20" width="20" /></p>
</blockquote>

<p>“Weeell…” - Persephone</p>

<p>Cobalt quickly lays out the facts. As he does so, Excalbur examines the bodies himself - casting <i>Forensic Gaze</i> himself. He nods at the ex-Zombies, and when he comes to the dead Moros examines the neck wound.</p>

<p>“Good shot” - Excalibur</p>

<p>“Lucky shot” - Persephone</p>

<p>He shrugs.</p>

<p>“Well. The Guardians should be satisfied by that. They’re making their way to the other half of the train now. It’ll be easier if we can get this half back there” - Excalibur</p>

<p>Cobalt heads to the driver’s cabin and puts the train into reverse</p>

<p>“You’re sure Cognos had nothing to do with this?” - Excalibur</p>

<p>“I’m sure” - Samael</p>

<p>“Because there was the complaint…” - Excalibur</p>

<p>“I’m <i>Sure</i>” - Samael</p>

<hr />

<p><b>Five Weeks Ago</b></p>

<p>In the tallest chamber of the lighthouse, Cobalt is learning all about Rote mudras…</p>

<p>“What’s a Mudra?” - Cobalt
“You know what a Mantra is?” - Cognos
“Like a chant?” - Cobalt</p>

<p>Cognos, at length, explains how Mudras are movements which act as mnemonics for Imagos</p>

<p>“…Like schoolkids learning a rhyme to remember their electromagnetic spectrum, yes? Well, a Mudra is like that but for a Rote.” - Cognos</p>

<blockquote class="bluetext">
  <p>For Agena’s benefit: Richard Of York Gave Battle In Vain. First letters of the visible light spectra. It’s a mnemonic.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>“And what’s a Rote?” - Cobalt</p>

<p>“Ah. Uh… Alright. When you cast a spell, you imagine how it works, yes? You form the Imago in your mind, imagine the lines of power moving, interacting with the surroundings? Well.. If you cut the main part of a spell’s shape out, minus the parts that take account of local conditions, that’s a Rote. It’s like having a 90% completed spell you can learn and fill the blanks in when you want it, but they’re quite difficult to remember - very complicated - hence Mudras” - Cognos</p>

<p>“Isn’t there a better way of doing it?” - Cobalt</p>

<p>“Well, some people use all kinds of mnemonics. I know an Obrimos in Paris that had himself tattooed with his rotes - parts of them on different parts of his arms, so that when he made certain gestures the Rote was visible. Very time-consuming…” - Cognos</p>

<blockquote class="bluetext">
  <p>Cognos is talking here about Hastur, one of the characters from <b>Bleak House</b>, as played by Rhyme of these forums. This is the first time I think I’ve indicated that all my Awakening games are set in the same continuity. Tattooed Rotes, like most advanced forms of magic, are from the Tome of Mysteries.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>“If he puts his forearms together, does it make a mage sight?” - Persphone, who has seen <i>Constantine</i>.</p>

<p>“No - shreds Ghosts. Lots of Ghosts in Paris.” - Cognos</p>

<p>Cobalt is more taken aback that there are <b>Mages</b> in Paris</p>

<p>“Oh, yes. Full of Geomancers and Guardians of the Veil, is Paris. The Mysterium and Guardians run something called a “Censorium” there, underground. It’s called ‘The Shadow Gallery’ - a vast collection of all the things they’d rather the rest of us didn’t know about.” - Cognos</p>

<p>“As opposed to Lorehouses?” - Cobalt</p>

<p>“Well of course - those are for everyone’s benefit. And Athenea are for the Mysterium’s. But a Censorium is for <em>no one’s</em>. There’s one in London, too - the Library of St John. If only there were a way to get inside… Think of all the secrets trapped within…” - Cognos</p>

<p>He drifts off for a moment, before his apprentices cough and re-attract his attention.</p>

<p>“I don’t think Samael would approve” - Persephone.</p>

<p>Cognos makes a dismissive noise, and the day’s lesson begins.</p>

<blockquote class="bluetext">
  <p>The Shadow Gallery and the Library of St John the Beheaded are both obscure parts of Doctor Who’s universe - they’re the 18th-century French and English equivalents of Torchwood. The Shadow Gallery made it into Bleak House as the Censorium Roach worked at.</p>

  <p>I mentioned them here because I might need a ultra-security library of Abyssal texts and demonological artefacts for the characters to break into at some point. This way, I get two!</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The day’s lesson, to be completed before they take Chayot the Tass they offerred earlier, is deceptively easy. In preparation for the upcoming Consilium, Cognos wants them able to cast a Mage Armor - a <i>good</i> Mage armor rather than the shoddy ones they’ve been able to put up so far. He chooses to use this as an illustration of ritual spellcasting: They are to carefully build the spells resonance-line by resonance-line, use the High Speech beforehand and employ sacraments. Persephone burns a playing card. Cognos uses a stone.</p>

<blockquote class="bluetext">
  <p>Or, put simply, they’re casting them as Extended rather than Instant spells, taking the opportunity to boost the Potency of the spells and so make them harder to dispel. Persephone is taking part in this lesson even though she should technically already know it.</p>

  <p>Agena: She knew she’s going to fail horribly at showing Cobalt that she’s more experienced in those matters but decided to go ahead anyway. And without fail, Cobalt finished his spell in less than 3,5 h it takes to cast the extended spell for people of our Gnosis + use of high speech while Sef sat there for full 9,5h, stubbornly trying to finish the spell and finally giving up and settling with a slightly less powerful (12 successes out of 15 I think) version of it. At least Cobalt did appreciate it though, as he said, he didn’t have to experience on himself what happens when one fails.</p>
</blockquote>

<hr />

<p>Meanwhile, over at the Farmhouse, Chayot and Samael are preparing a ritual casting of their own. Chayot has decided to Ward the house, and has been carefully painting the Runes of the High Speech onto the walls. Samael has the responsible job of making the necessary sacrament - an ice-sculpture of the Farmhouse in miniature, which will be melted during the casting. While Chayot is preparing the runes, he’s casting Forces spells on an ice-block to prevent it from melting except in the places he wishes. That plus a certain amount of manual craftsmanship is making the sacrament slowly take shape.</p>

<p>Once ready, the work completes - Samael standing by with the sculpture while Chayot carefully creates the <i>Ward</i>. At the required time, Samael releases the spells on the sculpture and allows it to begin melting. Hours later, the spell is finished. The walls hum with power.</p>

<p>Chayot has just sat down, Samael providing him with a cup of tea, when there’s the brilliant thunderclap of Cognos’ Nimbus. Cognos, Persephone and Cobalt <i>Teleport</i> into the Farmhouse, shattering the <i>Ward</i> into vanishing trails of resonance.</p>

<blockquote class="bluetext">
  <p>Cognos, without thinking, overcame the Potency of the Ward. The arrival was timed to maximum comedy effect - everyone knew it was coming…</p>
</blockquote>

<p>“Hello, Minions of Orthodoxy!” - Cognos, cheerfully, brandishing Tass in each hand.</p>

<p>“SIX HOURS OF WORK” - Chayot</p>

<p>Chayot strikes like a snake, whipping his cane up and screaming a word of power. Lightning forms around the silver cane-head and fires a split second later, arcing towards Cognos who ducks just in time. The Libertine recieves only a minor burn, but the vase behind him explodes.</p>

<p>“What THE?” - Cognos</p>

<blockquote class="bluetext">
  <p>The guys weren’t expecting THAT, though!</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Cobalt and Persephone dive for cover.</p>

<p>“Master!” - Samael</p>

<p>Chayot hurls another blast of lightning at Cognos, who hastily deflects some of it, but takes the majority of the blast straight in the chest, flying backward. He gets up, though, after a heart-stopping moment.</p>

<p>“YOU CRAZY BASTARD” - Cognos</p>

<p>Cobalt steps in between them. Chayot - who looked like he was going to cast it again - hesitates, then lowers his cane</p>

<p>“OUT” - Chayot</p>

<p>Cognos and Chayot hurl barely-intelligible insults at one another for a few moments, and then Cognos draws what’s left of his dignity up around him.</p>

<p>“RIGHT. Kids - with me. We’ll see what the Sentinel says about THIS!” - Cognos</p>

<p>And he storms out. At least he uses the door, though. Persephone and Cobalt hurry after him.</p>

<p>“I came to do him a FAVOUR. Let’s see him beg for access to a Hallow now, eh?” - Cognos, ranting</p>

<p>Samael looks like he’s about to try to argue it, but elects instead to stay and see if Chayot is still okay.</p>

<p>Outside, Persephone and Cobalt catch up with Cognos, who is healing himself in a glow of his Nimbus.</p>

<p>“Come on, we can still give them the Tass” - Persephone</p>

<p>“Bollocks can we.” - Cognos</p>

<p>“We might have just ruined something. What would you feel if he broke a spell you were working on?” - Persephone</p>

<p>“I need it to replenish the Mana I’m using to HEAL MYSELF” - Cognos</p>

<p>“You’re acting like an angry old man” - Cobalt</p>

<p>“I just got lightning-bolted by an angry old man.” - Cognos</p>

<p>“And yet, you’ve already healed yourself” - Cobalt</p>

<p>“Look at this waistcoat! RUINED” - Cognos</p>

<p>“I can fix that” - Cobalt</p>

<p>“It’s the <i>Principle</i>…” - Cognos</p>

<p>He seems more upset than anything. Persephone hugs him… And uses the opportunity to try to pick his pockets for the Tass.</p>

<p>“OI! No” - Cognos</p>

<p>He starts walking</p>

<p>Persephone turns the kitten-eyes on Cognos</p>

<p>“For Sam, at least! He doesn’t deserve to lose out” - Persephone</p>

<p>“…FINE. One - and for him, not Chayot” - Cognos</p>

<p>He hands over a chunk of metal grille - part of the floor of the Hallow chamber on top of the lighthouse, which has become Tass through Mana accumulation.</p>

<p>Persephone grins and runs back toward the farmhouse. Cognos, with a noise of disgust, <i>Teleports</i> home. Cobalt, left standing out in the drizzle by himself, decides to head after ‘Sef.</p>

<p>Through cunning means of Sef casting <i>Shifting the Odds</i>, Samael has gone to close the door just at the right time to see them coming back. Chayot, he says, is very weak from the sudden magical violence - he nearly keeled over. He explains how they’d just finished a spell that took them several hours to cast and that Cognos obliterated it without knowing.</p>

<blockquote class="bluetext">
  <p>Chayot just took three resistant damage from paradox - those <i>Thunderbolt</i> Spells don’t come cheap. Chayot absorbed the paradox as damage because the first one would have given him a Bedlam, which would have confused the scene even more, and the second was a Havok - which would have meant the Thunderbolt spell fired off at one of the player characters, to whom it would have done considerable damage and removed any sympathy for Chayot that there would have been - and we knew they had to feel upset enough at him dying at session’s end to go haring off after his killer.</p>

  <p>This is the point at which the whole nonlinear prelude got complicated, and the flow of the session was deliberately manipulated by all concerned to maintain continuity. My hat is off to the players, who coped admirably.</p>

  <p>Actually, when we came to play 1.1 I found I kind of missed it. I might try to do something similar for story two. <img class="emoji" title=":grinning:" alt=":grinning:" src="https://github.githubassets.com/images/icons/emoji/unicode/1f600.png" height="20" width="20" /></p>
</blockquote>

<p>Persephone hands over the Tass, which Samael receives gratefully.</p>

<p>“I think… I think in future you should call before coming over” - Samael</p>

<p>Cobalt opines that there is fault on both sides - both Adepts have failed to take one another’s business into account. The other two apprentices agree with him, but Samael says that probably won’t help: Chayot, like Cognos, has decided to take this to the Consilium. The three of them may be about to get caught in the middle.</p>

<p>“Do you want me to read your future for you?” - Persephone</p>

<p>He nods</p>

<p>Sef pulls out her tarot deck, putting random cards in a circle. Allowing her lucky arrow to drop randomly, she casts <i>Augery</i> on the farmhouse. The question - “Will the house be attacked in the coming week?” and the answer, clear as the mists of the future will allow, is No.</p>

<blockquote class="bluetext">
  <p>Because it will actually be attacked in a fortnight. Oh well…</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote class="bluetext">
  <p>Samael calls Chayot “Master” out of respect, and Persephone calls Cognos it sarcastically. Both are actually Adepts - I’m making a conscious effort to make Soul Cage lower-powered than Broken Diamond to avoid the PCs feeling feeble with their cut-down Mage templates and lack of xp.</p>
</blockquote>

<hr class="forum-break" />

<p><b>Now</b></p>

<blockquote class="bluetext">
  <p>Back to the train…</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Cobalt links up the train while Excalibur arranges for Cognos to be released in a phone call to someone unknown.</p>

<p>Once the car comes to a stop, a thin, balding man in a paramedic’s uniform climbs on board. The gang remember him from the Consilium - he’s a Guardian of the Veil.</p>

<p>“Gaunt” - Gaunt, extending his hand</p>

<p>The trio introduce themselves, as Gaunt goes around the corpses, giving them a third viewing. As he works, he quizzes the gang on what they did and didn’t do during the fight. He seems satisfied with their explanations (no Vulgar magic was used in front of Sleepers, they tried to get the Ghost away from the civilians), though mutters about the amount of work they’re going to have with the witnesses.</p>

<p>“Zombies. Why is it always Zombies? Damned Moros” - Gaunt</p>

<p>“I resent that” - Cobalt</p>

<p>“You’re a Moros?” - Gaunt</p>

<p>“Well… Yes, but I don’t go around making the Day of the Dead. We’re not all Necromancers” - Cobalt, slightly defensive</p>

<p>“Not implied. I’m a Moros myself. Men like <i>this</i> give us all a bad name” - Gaunt</p>

<p>As they watch, he disintegrates the bodies of the zombies one by one, reducing them to pale shadows on the floor.</p>

<p>“Have any of you seen him before?” - Gaunt, indicating the Moros</p>

<p>There is a chorus of denial</p>

<p>“Good clean shot” - Gaunt</p>

<p>Persephone shifts, uncomfortably.</p>

<p>“We’d best take the body, then. See what can be gleaned from it” - Gaunt, to Excalibur</p>

<p>“You need a hand?” - Cobalt</p>

<p>The dead Moros suddenly jerks to a sitting up position.</p>

<p>“Got it covered” - Gaunt</p>

<p>Cobalt wrinkles his face in distaste. Always with the Zombies.</p>

<blockquote class="bluetext">
  <p>Cobalt has an amusing problem with the stereotype of his Path, which only partly stems from Dave’s dislike of being lumbered with the Death Arcanum in order to get Matter. Cobalt describes himself, when asked to, as an Alchemist not a Necromancer.</p>

  <p>The Moros are the worst Path for that, I find - the other four fit together more intuitively, though there is much that can be made of the symbolism and magical energy of the Death/Matter split. In any case, we are reconciled to it as an Artifact of Mage: The Awakening as a game, and the dichotomy has been taken in character.</p>

  <p>Maybe one day, Cobalt will comes to terms with Death, and in so doing gain enlightenment. <img class="emoji" title=":grinning:" alt=":grinning:" src="https://github.githubassets.com/images/icons/emoji/unicode/1f600.png" height="20" width="20" /></p>
</blockquote>

<p>The Guardian puppets the body to it’s feet, and checks out the window what progress the hubbub of emergency services carrying off passengers has made.</p>

<p>“Wait” - Samael</p>

<p>He ties a scarf around the new zombie’s neck, covering up the gaping arrow wound.</p>

<p>Gaunt raises an eyebrow, nods to him and then commands the corpse to climb out of the train. He follows it, and Excalibur coughs for attention.</p>

<p>“We need to talk to Bede” - Samael</p>

<blockquote class="bluetext">
  <p>Because they have an Artifact with Death and Fate spells on it that someone is willing to kill for.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>“Tomorrow. It’s nearly three AM - I’ll take you back to the Lighthouse, okay?” - Excalibur</p>

<p>They climb down from the train and into Excalibur’s land rover. The sentinel waits for Gaunt to give the go-ahead, and then starts driving the trio back South, towards the Lighthouse and the…</p>

<p>… Samael doesn’t really want to think about that right now.</p>

<p>“You realise why we had to take Cognos in, right?” - Excalibur</p>

<p>“Yeah. We know” - Cobalt, sadly</p>

<p>“I mean, they’re reprimanded for fighting and then two weeks later… Bad business. I just hope we can find out who that guy was…” - Excalibur</p>

<p>He realises he’s mostly talking to himself and shuts up, leaving the exhausted trio to get a moment’s peace.</p>

<hr />

<p><b>Two Weeks Ago</b></p>

<p>The three young Mages have spent the last two weeks mediating between their two mentors - both of whom are still angry at one another and both of whom have complained to the heads of their respective Order Caucuses. While Cobalt, Persephone and Samael have taken to meeting one another at the pub in the village further down the road (Cobalt, it seems, has an unerring capability to locate a bar no matter where he is)</p>

<blockquote class="bluetext">
  <p>Cobalt has the ‘Barfly’ Merit. <img src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7" class="smilie smilie--sprite smilie--sprite8" alt=":D" title="Big grin    :D" data-shortname=":D" /></p>
</blockquote>

<p>When the day of the Consilium eventually comes around, the trio are therefore looking forward to it less than they might have been.</p>

<p>The Free Council Caucus is held in the lower floor of a pub in Durham, hanging over the grey River Wear. The bar is an independent, and has ale tasting as though it were produced from the river.</p>

<blockquote class="bluetext">
  <p>Real bar, this. Good memories… No… Wait… Not good memories.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>They’re met by a small, bald man in cheap spectacles and a cheaper, faded suit. Cobalt recognises him - he works at Durham University’s Physics department.</p>

<p>“Greetings, Voters!” - Quark, enthusiastically</p>

<blockquote class="bluetext">
  <p>Okay. obligatory Physics joke, because it pleased Agena: Quark is small and excited.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>“Good lord” - Cobalt</p>

<p>“I know! Small world.. Quark. I’m the Emissary” - Quark</p>

<p>“Emissary?” - Persephone</p>

<p>“Well - I’m on the Consilium Council. My colleagues there run ‘their’ Orders with different degrees of autocracy, but we’re different. We discuss everything on their agenda ahead of time, add our own items, vote on the Free Council’s position and then I put those views to Aurora” - Quark</p>

<blockquote class="bluetext">
  <p>Quark is a Thredonist - a Technomagic-based Mastigos that uses Quantum physics to explore the bleed-point between Mind and Space. The way the Durham Libertines work is one model of how the Assembly system can fit into the Consilium one, and relies on Aurora deliberately having one Councillor of each of the Four Orders other than herself - if there weren’t a Libertine Councillor, this wouldn’t work.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>“Everyone! This is Persephone and Cobalt” - Quark, to the amassed Libertines.</p>

<p>Well… Amassed is probably not the word. Clumped, maybe. The aging hippy in the world war two German army jacket is “Pythagoras”. The young, friendly redhaired woman is “Symmetry”. The rather thuggish young man with the inpenetrably thick County Durham Mining Village accent is “Cobra”. This singular individual stops playing with a knife and leering at Symmetry long enough to register Persephone’s entrance.</p>

<p>”..” - Cobra, intaking breath as if to speak</p>

<p>“I have a boyfriend” - Persephone, very quickly</p>

<blockquote class="bluetext">
  <p>Cobra, bless him, is in the Chronicle to show the downside of the Libertines - the flaw of Democracy being that it assumes all Voters have an equal grasp of things. Also, he’s very roughly based on someone me and Dave know, which Dave found rather funny. Even after he was named for the empty bottle of beer Chris has on his PC desk.</p>

  <p>There are other Libertines present - about 12 in total, including the two pcs - but at that point I’d given up naming them. More show up next session, after I’d had chance to sit down and properly name Cabals and things.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>“All right?” - Cobra, to Cobalt</p>

<p>“Er.. Yeah” - Cobalt</p>

<p>Symmetry inches closer to them, as Quark gets the meeting started.</p>

<p>“Okay! So! We have a few things to talk about…” - Quark</p>

<p>Cognos looms, clearing his throat</p>

<p>(hastily) “…Foremost the assault on Cognos here. Before that, though, does anyone have anything they wish to address the Assembly with?” - Quark</p>

<p>Symmetry and Cobra both raise their hands. First it’s Cobra. He wants to Fight The Lie, whatever that means. He has had a “cunning” plan - break into one of the RAF bases in the region and steal some heavy weaponry, then take the fight to the jailers of mankind. What can possibly go wrong? Pythagoras seems to be agreeing, but he also seems to be stoned.</p>

<p>Quark shifts uncomfortably, as chairperson unable to oppose. He asks if anyone has anything to say on it before it goes to a vote.</p>

<p>“You can’t fight the man with the weapons of the man” - Cobalt, muttering</p>

<p>“Yes? Cobalt! Cobalt - you have the floor!” - Quark, desperate.</p>

<p>Cobalt, realising no one else is going to oppose it, steps on up.</p>

<p>“To those who support this plan, I have to say that you cannot fight The Man with the weapons of The Man, without becoming The Man yourself” - Cobalt</p>

<p>Pythagoras nods sagely at that.</p>

<p>“…And to everyone else, I’d like to say: This plan is retarded” - Cobalt</p>

<p>He wins the vote by a landslide. Quark giving him a grateful look as he acknowledges it.</p>

<blockquote class="bluetext">
  <p>Which Dave will use as justification for buying Free Council Status 1 after the story. And now for Samael…</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Symmetry goes second - she’s noticed an unusual pattern of ghosts in Newcastle, that manifest in the middle of crowded areas at night and then are almost immediately forced away by Disbelief. That they are affected by Paradox would seem to indicate that they’re being forced to Manifest by Magic, and she suspects Seer of the Throne or Banisher involvement. She intends to appeal for volunteers to help uncover the truth at the Mysterium.</p>

<p>The assembled Libertines vote in favour, and then it’s Chayot’s turn, putting his side of the story to the Assembly. Persephone is the one to bring up the Ward he smashed through</p>

<p>Samael and Chayot, meanwhile, are meeting with the Mysterium Councillor - a Moros of the Stone Scribe Legacy named Bede.</p>

<blockquote class="bluetext">
  <p>I’ve always liked the Stone Scribes, and their powers based around establishing temporal sympathy to the deceased, but the members of the Legacy in Broken Diamond faded into the background. Having someone who can, given enough things with “known” connections to the deceased, gain temporal sympathy to any dead mages that may be littering the place will be useful in future stories.</p>

  <p>And yes, Chris, he’s been retconned from being a Thyrsus.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Bede and a junior Mystagogue - A Dudekos in the Order’s terminology - named Key are meeting Samael and Chayot in the warren-like St John’s College. Originally a row of townhouses, John’s is full of random staircases, floors that don’t meet up, doors to nowhere and so forth. One of those doors in fact leads to Key’s office. There, surrounded by books, files and strange objects, the Mystagogues are going over Chayot’s complaint about Cognos.</p>

<p>Bede is an elderly man, sober and knowing. Once Chayot has finished, he asks Samael’s opinion.</p>

<p>“I think Cognos was trying to do us a favour, but didn’t think” - Samael</p>

<p>“Well. The Hierarch will decide” - Bede</p>

<blockquote class="bluetext">
  <p>Bede is named after the Venerable Bede. Key has a backstory, but as she hasn’t had a speaking part yet I will leave it until it’s important. That way I can change it.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>They get up to go, leaving the college and walking through the old town of Durham towards the Castle.</p>

<blockquote class="bluetext">
  <p>Durham is pretty compact - have a look on Google Maps. The Bailey - the old town - containing the Cathedral, the Castle and the posher half of the University’s Colleges, is built on a peninsula formed by a loop in the river.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Chayot and Key go on ahead, leaving Bede and Samael trailing behind.</p>

<p>“Have you given any thought to your direction after your apprenticeship?” - Bede</p>

<p>“I haven’t. I wanted to see more of the Order’s work” - Samael</p>

<p>“There’s more to us than the Eregore, and there are always opportunities for a young Mystagogue without attachments. Chayot tells me you’re interested in Art History?” - Bede</p>

<p>Samael nods</p>

<p>“Well, I have an ex-student - an Archaeomancer - who’s leading an expedition in Brazil soon. They’re assembling in Rio De Janeiro and then seeking out indications of an Atlantean site. If you’re interested, I will persuade Chayot to allow you to go through your second Initiation and release you from your Apprenticeship. From the sound of it, you’re ready.” - Bede</p>

<p>“I… Thank you” - Samael</p>

<blockquote class="bluetext">
  <p>The Brazil Expedition will be the plot of Story Two, most likely. Assuming Samael ever actually tells the others about it.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>As the Mystagogues take one road towards the castle, they can see the throng of Libertines taking another in the distance. The two groups converge on the Castle gate. Cognos and Chayot glare at one another, but Bede and Quark set an example.</p>

<p>“How’s the yearning for scraps from the ancients’ table?” - Quark, friendly</p>

<p>“Fair. How is reinventing the wheel?” - Bede, equally friendly</p>

<p>“Can’t complain” - Quark</p>

<blockquote class="bluetext">
  <p>I think this may be a ripoff of Terry Pratchett, now that I think of it. Such is the pop-culture cauldron of my brain. I had to stop myself from naming a particular character “Odo” after the Norman Bishop, realising at the last minute that it really wouldn’t look good given Quark’s name.</p>

  <p>Which is, of course, after the subatomic particle. Physics, people, Physics.</p>

  <p>Anyway - at this point there was a break to explore the possibilities of a Mysterium vs Free Council Dance-Off, in true Street style…</p>
</blockquote>

<p>…</p>

<p>The Mages cross the Castle’s inner courtyard and go into the main building, heading down stairs and into the cellars. Here, there are signs warning students that the area has been booked for a private function.</p>

<p>The Consilium assembles in the vaulted cellars - the nearest part to the exit of which have been converted into a bar.</p>

<blockquote class="bluetext">
  <p>In fact, this is where I waited, many years ago, to Graduate from Durham University. I think, maybe, that I am only capable of using the NOrth East as a rpg setting now that I don’t live there - it’s now seperate enough that I can treat it like a fictional setting, but my own memories of what places look like are there to help out.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The trio are singled out by a tall, blonde woman who towers over the pair of them. She’s <i>handsome</i> rather than pretty, with a certain set to her jaw that speaks of suffering no nonsense.</p>

<p>“I’m Aurora, the Hierarch. I’m in charge here” - Aurora</p>

<p>They gape</p>

<p>“The three of you, it seems, are more capable of coexisting than your supposed ‘betters’. Do you have names?” - Aurora</p>

<p>“Uh.. Cobalt” - Cobalt</p>

<p>“Yes. Quark says you’re something of an Orator. Not hard in the Libertines. Hopefully you can keep your teacher grounded” - Aurora</p>

<p>“And I’m Samael” - Samael</p>

<p>“At last. We knew Chayot had an apprentice. Great things are expected” - Aurora</p>

<p>Samael doesn’t quite know what to make of that.</p>

<p>The Heirarch turns to Persephone, and then, disconcertingly, smiles.</p>

<p>“Hello dear” - Aurora, suddenly friendly</p>

<p>“…Hello” - Persephone</p>

<p>“I’m Aurora. And you?” - Aurora</p>

<p>“…Persephone” - Persephone</p>

<p>“Pleased to meet you” - Aurora</p>

<blockquote class="bluetext">
  <p>Aurora is noticeably nicer to Persephone than she is to the other two - more patient, too</p>
</blockquote>

<p>She goes back to regarding all three of them, and the friendliness and patience vanish again.</p>

<p>“Now. I’m going to give your damn fool mentors a talking to. You can talk to Excalibur here” - Aurora</p>

<p>She marches off, leaving Excalibur to introduce himself as the Consilium’s Sentinel.</p>

<blockquote class="bluetext">
  <p>Singular - he’s the only one.</p>

  <p>A brief bit of background, game-design-wise, on Excalibur. I designed the overall shape of the plot - that the Mystagogue mentor would be aware that someone was trying to steal the Artifact from him - before the player characters properly took shape, and in particular before Dave joined the chronicle and Cobalt was designed. The references here and there of Chayot considering hiring an Adamantine Arrow to act as the Cabal’s Banner Warden are leftovers from that earlier iteration of the plot - if Persephone and Samael had both been Mystagogues (as looked like happening for a while there) and they’d been the only characters, then there would have been a npc Cabal member to bring them up to three, in the style of Mycroft in Broken Diamond. Said character would have been the hired Banner Warden, who wouldn’t have considered his oath to protect them nullified by Chayot’s death and would have hung around as the pcs’ bodyguard.</p>

  <p>Excalibur is the remnants of that character, repurposed as the Cabal’s contact in the Arrow.</p>

  <p>Cognos - and the entire plot about the fight - was added quite late in the day after I found I needed a Free Council mentor as well as Chayot.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>“How’s it going up there in the wilderness?” - Excalibur</p>

<p>“Exciting” - Cobalt</p>

<p>“Could be worse. Aurora could have been your Mentor. Here’s how this works. Aurora will figure out what’s going to happen and then tell me what decision to come to” - Excalibur</p>

<p>Over his shoulder, they can see Cognos and Chayot being talked at by the Heirarch. She holds her hand up for silence when Cognos starts to rant, and when she speaks, she speaks quickly and clearly, emphasising it with a chopping motion. The two Adepts retreat to their respective Order cliques after she’s done with them, and she marches back over to the trio.</p>

<p>“Ten Tass for Chayot and a Grimoire of choice for Cognos” - Aurora</p>

<p>Excalibur nods to the Heirarch and retreats from the conversation.</p>

<p>The Consilium itself is a short affair. Aurora formally - and quickly - introduces the trio as new members and then calls for reports and matters of import. Excalibur gives the Adamantine Arrows’ report on dangers - there have been no problems in the last quarter, with the Seers lying low. Symmetry repeats her open call for volunteers, and some of the Mages present look like they’re considering it.</p>

<p>Then comes the Fight.</p>

<p>“And to the last matter.” - Aurora.</p>

<p>Calling Chayot and Cognos forward, Excalibur says - glancing at Aurora - that both are guilty according to the Lex Magica - Chayot for attacking a fellow Leigeman, and Cognos for violating Chayot’s Sanctum. Cognos is ordered to give up a sizeable quantity of Tass sufficient for Chayot’s needs, and Chayot is to provide Cognos with books from his library sufficient for Cobalt’s training in the Matter Arcanum.</p>

<p>Neither Adept seems happy with the result, but Aurora - stood behind Excalibur - fixes them with a steely look, and they don’t make an issue of it.</p>

<p>“All right. That’s it” - Aurora</p>

<p>She walks out without a backward glance, and the Consilium begins to break up.</p>

<p>“Could have been worse. Could have been the Duel Arcane” - Samael</p>

<p>There’s a cough at Cobalt’s shoulder, and he turns to find Symmetry regarding him</p>

<p>“Hi! I didn’t get the chance earlier - I was really impressed at Assembly” - Symmetry</p>

<p>“When are you meeting for the Ghost-hunting?” - Persephone</p>

<p>“You’re in? Great! We’re sorting it out.. Here’s my number. We’ll be in touch once we know how many people we get” - Symmetry</p>

<p>Cognos stomps over to them</p>

<p>(without looking at Samael) “We’re Leaving” - Cognos</p>

<hr class="forum-break" />

<p><b>Now</b></p>

<p>Excalibur’s landrover pulls up outside the Lighthouse. The lights are on inside.</p>

<p>“Looks like Cognos got back before us” - Excalibur</p>

<p>“You want to come in?” - Persephone</p>

<p>“I’d better not. Bede is expecting me, and I’ve got a long night ahead of me. I’ve got two men down at the house making sure no one disturbs the place until you arrive. I’ll be along tomorrow lunchtime to take Samael to see Bede.” - Excalibur</p>

<p>They get out. In the dark, they can’t see the ruin of Chayot’s house, but they can smell the smoke.</p>

<p>“Samael.” - Excalibur</p>

<p>“Yes?” - Samael</p>

<p>“I really am very sorry for your loss” - Excalibur</p>

<p>And he leaves, gravel crunching beneath his wheels.</p>

<p>Cobalt opens the front door, Persephone right behind him. Samael trails behind, unsure.</p>

<p>Inside the Lighthouse, Cognos is packing. Throwing possessions into boxes in a whirlwind of activity. He stops, holding a russian doll in one hand, when the trio enter the room.</p>

<p>“Samael, my boy, I…” - Cognos</p>

<p>He trails off, eventually shrugging apologetically. Unable to say anything else.</p>

<p>“You’re leaving” - Persephone, numbly stating the fact</p>

<p>“I may be innocent, but the Mysterium won’t see it like that. They’ll make my life hell… And, well… I don’t think I like this place any more. I could spend years and plenty of sacrifice making up for it, but.. I can’t be bothered” - Cognos</p>

<p>“Where will you go?” - Samael</p>

<p>“Don’t know yet. Maybe I’ll travel for a while before settling into a new Consilium. We’ll see. Now… The three of you… Thank you. For believing it wasn’t me” - Cognos</p>

<p>“I know who it was. Chayot’s old Cabal… I just don’t know which one of them” - Samael</p>

<p>“Did he..?” - Cognos</p>

<p>“His corpse is with the Guardians” - Cobalt</p>

<p>“Persephone killed him” - Samael</p>

<p>Persephone looks at the floor, uncomfortable, but is surprised when Cognos hugs her.</p>

<p>“Cognos… Can I ask you a question?” (serious) “You remember I asked you about a member of Chayot’s Cabal? The man that visited us?” - Samael</p>

<p>“Duma duma duma duma?” (sadly) “Yes, and no - i’m afraid I still don’t know who that is. But I will ask around, lad - and when I find him, rest assured I will be in touch.” - Cognos</p>

<blockquote class="bluetext">
  <p>The Duma duma duma is a callback to last session</p>
</blockquote>

<p>“Look at the three of you. A Cabal. You make me proud. Even you, Samael - and should you tire of the Mysterium I’m sure the Free Council will take you” - Cognos</p>

<p>“I hope not” - Samael</p>

<p>The Libertine laughs.</p>

<p>“Did you get what he took back?” - Cognos</p>

<p>Samael produces the Ankh, and all present cast Mage Sight spells to examine it. Cobalt notes it has Death resonance, and Persephone says it’s Fated…</p>

<p>“How Fated are we talking? Keys to Atlantis or next week’s lottery numbers?” - Cobalt</p>

<p>Samael attempts to cast <i>Analyse Magic Item</i>, but fails.</p>

<p>“You could always activate it” - Cognos, quietly</p>

<p>He’s tempted… But no.</p>

<p>“No… Not without knowing what it does. Maybe someone else can make a better go of analysing it” - Samael</p>

<p>“All right. Bed, everyone. Bed. Even you, Sam.” - COgnos</p>

<p>Persephone hugs him.</p>

<p>“What?” - Cognos</p>

<p>“Will you be here tomorrow?” - Persephone</p>

<p>(lying) “Of Course” - Cognos</p>

<p>Persephone and Samael head upstairs to try to find Sam somewhere to sleep.</p>

<p>Cobalt shakes Cognos’ hand.</p>

<p>“Take care out there” - Cobalt</p>

<p>“Shouldn’t I be saying that to you?” - Cognos</p>

<p>He shrugs</p>

<p>“Look after these two, won’t you Cobalt?” - Cognos</p>

<p>“Sure. Will you write?” - Cobalt</p>

<p>“As often as I can… And you have my apologies.. for everything I haven’t managed to teach you yet that the others will have to fill in. Sef can help. She’s a fine young lady” - Cognos</p>

<p>He winks. Cobalt ignores it.</p>

<p>…</p>

<p>Exhausted, everyone goes to sleep - Samael bedding down on the battered sofa, wrapped in blankets.</p>

<p>In the morning, to no one’s surprise, Cognos has gone. The trio… the Cabal… eat a short breakfast, get their coats on and hike down the track towards the ruin of Chayot’s house.</p>

<blockquote class="bluetext">
  <p>Cognos will return, at some point in the Chronicle. Probably in the unlikliest of circumstances.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><b>Last Night</b></p>

<p>The trio have been out at an Archery competition, then the pub, and are walking back through the pouring rain towards Chayot’s house when they see light flickering ahead.</p>

<p>“Is that the lighthouse?” - Samael</p>

<p>“It doesn’t work” - Cobalt</p>

<p>“Is that.. Your house?” - Persephone</p>

<p>It is.</p>

<p>They start running.</p>

<blockquote class="bluetext">
  <p>The Archery Competition was a last-minute save, as we realised Persephone needed to have her bow on her in order for continuity to match up.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>“MASTER!” - Samael</p>

<p>The house is burning. Manuscripts, tomes and scrolls being destroyed by the flames licking at the windows. As the trio run up, the windows shatter, overcome by the heat.</p>

<p>Samael puts his arm up in front of his face protectively, and tries as best he can to use <i>Compel flame</i> to make a path through the fires. The ceiling is making ominous creaking noises as the beams turn black, and Cobalt desperately uses <i>Reshape</i> to thicken parts of the walls, holding the upper floor in place.</p>

<p>“CHAYOT!” - Samael</p>

<p>He finds him on the first floor, lying in front of the shattered cabinet in which the Ankh lay.</p>

<p>Samael sinks to Chayot’s side, checking for any sign of life. Downstairs, Cobalt is saving what books he can, opening the wall behind bookcases and flinging the books out onto the grass outside.</p>

<p>“SEF!” - Samael</p>

<p>Persephone reaches Samael, and casts <i>Postcognition</i>…</p>

<p><i>Chayot, hearing a sound, comes upstairs to find the Moros entering the house - materialising from the Twilight. He immediately casts <i>Thunderbolt</i>, but the Moros dodges it - and the blast sets the curtains behind him on fire. The Moros then casts something at Chayot, who clutches his chest and falls to his knees. In agony, Chayot slowly falls unconcious as the Moros smashes the cabinet and takes the Ankh reverently. The thief then pauses, as if considering, and casts his spell on Chayot again… and again. Standing over Chayot as the Mystagogue’s life is snuffed out. He leaves by the front door, getting into a car and speeding away in the direction of the train track.</i></p>

<p>…</p>

<p>Samael and Persephone rush down the stairs, yelling for Cobalt as they leave. Chayot’s car is still outside, and a quick spell from Samael locates the keys amid the wreckage of the ground floor on the way out.</p>

<p>Samael casts an Unveiling Practice of Forces, revealing the trail of the thief’s car heat.</p>

<p>“FOLLOW THAT CAR” - Samael</p>
