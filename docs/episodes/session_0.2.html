<blockquote class="bluetext">
  <p>Welcome back, faithful Reader!
We continue our non-linear exploration of these characters we call ‘player’ in this session, which in terms of a strict linear progression is made up of the third section of six, the second section of six being included as a flashback.</p>

  <p>Except for one brief few-seconds flash of the sixth section. Hopefully, for those scratching their heads, this will fill in more gaps.</p>

  <p>This is also where we are introduced to most of our primary cast of Storyteller Characters, and the groundwork laid for appearances as-yet-unseen. There’s a fair amount of namedropping in the cause of foreshadowing, layering and other storytelling techniques that make it seem less like the game is a caffeine-induced fever and more like a coherent narrative. Almost everyone will turn out to be important.</p>

  <p>Less of the blue notes this week as it’s pretty much all dialogue, which speaks for itself.</p>

<p><b>Two Months Ago</b></p>

<p>Rex sits in his office at his pc, watching himself be dragged up from the depths of the sea. One of the students - he suspects it was the implode/explode one - put mobile phone footage of the entire thing onto YouTube.</p>

<p>The office is a bit of a mess, as most academic offices in the fresher’s week are. Graded dissertations lay stacked on a chair, journals are strewn and marked with scrap paper bookmarks. In the corner is a fish tank, containing a few goldfish and (after the porter found it in the ornamental pond on campus) a model of Rex in his diving suit made from a GI Joe, the eyes turned into little Xs with magic marker.</p>

<p>It’s been a month.</p>

<p>The tale has grown in the retelling, such that every student now knows an exaggerated version of it. It even made the news. His colleagues have been tip-toeing around him, and it’s with a sinking (no pun intended) feeling that he greets his head of department when she knocks on the door.</p>

<p>“Hello Joyce” - Rex</p>

<p>.</p>

<p>Ten minutes later, and Rex is looking at a printed sheet of his postgraduate students along with which of his colleagues will be taking over as their tutors. His research leave was due to be the academic year after next, but it’s been swapped with someone else. The few remaining months of this term are noted as “leave of absence”.</p>

<p>To Joyce’s credit, she at least did say ‘come back when this blows over’ rather than just imply it. He appreciates the directness.</p>

<blockquote class="bluetext">
  <p>We haven’t specifically said, but this sequence - and the bulk of the session - is set in early September 2007, making the “present” of the Chronicle November and the sequence of <abbr title="characters/cobalt">Cobalt</abbr>’s diving accident last time August - the time when Universities do things like have long field trips on ships. It has to be set around here so that Persephone’s Awakening can be in June. The reason for the sabbatical is so that <abbr title="characters/cobalt">Cobalt</abbr> can go through his apprenticeship and the first year or so of adventures without me having to worry about his life’s commitments, but I do want to show him teaching at some point. It’s an Indiana Jones thing.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The afternoon trudges on, the noise of students out in the sunshine drifting up to Rex’s window. Gradually, Rex becomes aware of a shadow behind the glass set into his office door.</p>

<p>“Come in!” - Rex</p>

<p>The gentleman that does so is a quite singular individual. The cowboy boots, blue jeans, green tweed suit jacket and waistcoat and wide, floppy black hat would each be the start of a outfit, but mixed together produce something quite eccentric. The sheer enthusiastic bulk of the man, cheerful eyes peering out above the full beard, rotund belly attempting to escape the waistcoat, puts Rex in mind of Father Christmas.</p>

<p>Or Mudstrum Ridcully.</p>

<p>Naturally, Rex assumes he’s from the Humanities Faculty. Maybe a Geographer.</p>

<p>“Hullo!” - Cognos</p>

<p>He peers at Rex expectantly.</p>

<p>“Can I help you, professor?” - Rex</p>

<p>“Quite the opposite! Quite the opposite! No, I’m here to help <em>you</em>. After what happened.” - Cognos</p>

<p>Ah, now Rex has it. He’s from the <em>Union</em>…</p>

<p>The newcomer puts his hand to the door and seems briefly distracted. There’s a brief buzzing sound as Rex’s guts lurch in a manner reminiscent to his diving accident and then… silence.</p>

<p>“There we are” - Cognos, happily</p>

<p>Rex glances out of the window. The traffic crawls steadily past campus in the distance, the Hospital next door to the University is still there and students continue to walk about, play Frisbee and drink too much. But they’re all doing so in absolute silence.</p>

<p>“Neat trick” - Rex</p>

<p>“We can talk privately now. I take it you are on sick leave?” - Cognos</p>

<p>“Yes… And how did you do that?” - Rex</p>

<p>“I’ve had occasion to witness the insane babble of preternatural intelligences in my career. Undergraduates remind me of this.” - Cognos</p>

<p>Rex lets that non-answer slide off, focusing on the important.</p>

<p>“You knew I would be put on sabbatical?” - Rex</p>

<p>“I did. I’ve been waiting most of the day for her to do it. Cognos is my name.” - Cognos.</p>

<p>“Cognos?” - Rex, sceptically</p>

<p>The older man smiles in a jolly fashion. Definitely more Ridcully than Santa.</p>

<p>“I’m here about the dive. About where you went” - Cognos</p>

<p>“To the bottom of the sea?” - Rex</p>

<p>“The other place. When you Changed. Let me guess… You instinctively repaired your suit, so I’d say… Lead was involved?” - Cognos</p>

<p>And now Rex knows that he didn’t imagine it.</p>

<p>“Lead.. The air, the ground, the water… Where was that? What happened to me?” - Rex</p>

<p>“How can I put this? Oh! I know! Just the ticket… Ahem… Y’er a WIZARD, Harry!” - Cognos, doing his best Robbie Coltrane impression.</p>

<p>“What?” - Rex, flatly disbelieving.</p>

<p>Cognos, griping that his ‘apprentice’ told him that line would work, tells Rex that his near-death experience was a Gnostic experience - Rex has been to the land of the dead and, having made his mark there, is now Awakened. A Mage. One of the Wise…</p>

<p>“The suit was fine. It checked out.” - Rex</p>

<p>“I know. I saw it on youtube” - Cognos</p>

<p>“Then you know I didn’t repair it” - Rex</p>

<p>“What they didn’t tell you is that it fell apart an hour after you were pulled up. Magic wears off, you see. When you came back from the land of the dead there was just enough time to save yourself” - Cognos</p>

<p>“The land of the dead” - Rex, sceptical, still</p>

<p>“The Path Moros in the Realm of Stygia, where lies the Watchtower of the Lead Coin” - Cognos</p>

<p>“So… Did YOU go there?” - Rex, catching on.</p>

<p>“Me? Oh, no. No. I went to Hell” - Cognos, happily.</p>

<blockquote class="bluetext">
  <p>Cognos has a booming voice, a cheerful manner and no sense of tact. He is, as implied, a Mastigos.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>“Look. I’m having a bad day. This sounds… True <u>and</u> Crazy. I’m trying to believe, but I’m having trouble… Show me some proof” - Rex</p>

<p>“Proof, eh?” - Cognos</p>

<p>The Mastigos looks around the office, and spots Rex’s nameplate on his desk.</p>

<p>“How are you saying that?” - Cognos</p>

<p>Rex dubiously pronounces his name. Cognos repeats it a few times, getting the feel of it. Rex feels that queasy feeling again, and Cognos mutters something about the return being taken care of.</p>

<p>Then Rex’s office vanishes in a blur of light. He suddenly finds himself falling - at speed - high above the ground. Skydiving without a parachute. After a few seconds, there’s another blur and he lands, sprawled, on his office floor.</p>

<p>“Will that do?” - Cognos</p>

<p>“… … Yeah. That’ll do” - Rex</p>

<blockquote class="bluetext">
  <p>Mechanically, Cognos just cast <i>Teleport</i> twice - the first time with a Time 2 component to activate after a minute’s delay. Delay-timed spells aren’t actually covered in Awakening, but I figure that if you can hang a spell to go off when you mentally command it to, you can put one on a timer. Besides - it’s good for cheap tricks.</p>

  <p>If that view of the mechanics offends you, assume Cognos just hit Rex with a hallucination <img class="emoji" title=":grinning:" alt=":grinning:" src="https://github.githubassets.com/images/icons/emoji/unicode/1f600.png" height="20" width="20" /></p>
</blockquote>

<p>“Let that be your first lesson. I was able to do that because I know your name. Real names have power - hence ‘Cognos’. If you’re to survive in this game you’ll need a tag” - Cognos</p>

<p>“A tag?” - Rex</p>

<p>“You know, a Haxxor Name. Something leet” - Cognos, pronouncing the terms with the air of someone that’s never heard them said.</p>

<p>“<i>Haxxor</i>?” - Rex</p>

<p>“Oh yes - I’m down with the kids. I know the lingo.” - Cognos, proudly.</p>

<p>“Riight.” - Rex</p>

<p>He looks over his office, and spots the periodic table hanging on the wall.</p>

<p>“<abbr title="characters/cobalt">Cobalt</abbr>. Number twenty-seven” - <abbr title="characters/cobalt">Cobalt</abbr></p>

<p>“<i><abbr title="characters/cobalt">Cobalt</abbr></i>? Are you sure?” - Cognos</p>

<p>He looks dubiously at the table</p>

<p>“Sure you wouldn’t rather have Neon? Einsteinium? Ununhexium?” - Cognos, slightly disparagingly.</p>

<p>“<abbr title="characters/cobalt">Cobalt</abbr>. And Who’ll use my name against me?” - <abbr title="characters/cobalt">Cobalt</abbr></p>

<p>“Well… Not everyone in our line is particularly friendly. People think of Mages, if they think of them at all, as being wise and calm councils of old men - everyone working together for enlightenment. Truth is, we’re like any field of study. Rivalries. Office Politics. You’re an Academic - you know how this goes.” - Cognos</p>

<p><abbr title="characters/cobalt">Cobalt</abbr> nods, thinking</p>

<p>“You went to Hell?” - <abbr title="characters/cobalt">Cobalt</abbr></p>

<p>“I did. Just wait till you meet my apprentice. She was away with the faeries. There are others” - Cognos</p>

<p>“The Dead. Hell. Faeries. Aliens?” - <abbr title="characters/cobalt">Cobalt</abbr></p>

<p>“Are Faeries. Long story - but Heaven and the Garden of Eden are your other choices. You’re a Moros - that’s the name for Mages that go where you went” - Cognos</p>

<p>“What happens now?” - <abbr title="characters/cobalt">Cobalt</abbr></p>

<p>“Well… There is much to learn. The Secrets of the Universe. If you’re willing, I can teach you as much as you need to get along. How to use your abilities, who your fellows are.” - Cognos</p>

<p>“Where do we start?” - <abbr title="characters/cobalt">Cobalt</abbr></p>

<p>The Mage considers.</p>

<p>“Pub” - Cognos</p>

<blockquote class="bluetext">
  <p>I occasionally have characters describe the Primal Wild as being Eden. It’s a thing - and as valid an interpretation as calling Stygia Purgatory. Cognos uses my favourite explanation for Alien encounters in the nWoD - abduction-type ones are Fae.</p>

  <p>Though I do like the hints in Astral Realms about UFOs being from the Temenos.</p>

<p>…</p>

<blockquote class="bluetext">
  <p>From <abbr title="characters/cobalt">Cobalt</abbr> to <abbr title="characters/samael">Samael</abbr>, as we catch up with the Obrimos a long time after his explosive Awakening. This next sequence kicks off a long-running plotline - maybe the ‘entire chronicle’ kind of long-running.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><abbr title="characters/samael">Samael</abbr> is practicing the Compelling Practice of Forces, sat in front of the thermostat. As he concentrates, he makes the temperature go up and down by a few degrees.</p>

<p>Months of this.</p>

<p><abbr title="characters/samael">Samael</abbr> was arrested for arson of the church, but bail paid by the Mage who became his mentor - a Mystagogue Obrimos named Chayot - and charges dropped. Months later <abbr title="characters/samael">Samael</abbr> is still living at Chayot’s remote house. Still working on his Practices. There’s a hamlet about a mile in one direction and in the other is the Northumberland coast, where a Free Councillor called Cognos lives with his own Apprentice. The two older mages have a relationship best described as friendly dislike, while the Apprentices get on. Persephone has only been here for four months, but she’s nearly caught up with <abbr title="characters/samael">Samael</abbr> on everything except the Arcana - he’s had time to learn more, but she’s rapidly gaining on him. That’s mostly down to the different training regimens - Chayot is a lot more careful than Cognos, and <abbr title="characters/samael">Samael</abbr> has had the importance of getting the small things exactly right drummed well and truly into him. As Chayot puts it, every Imago <abbr title="characters/samael">Samael</abbr> makes is like a stained glass window in his mind, focusing the fires of Aether into the dark world. Done properly it’s illuminating, but if <abbr title="characters/samael">Samael</abbr> lets his concentration slip… churches burn down.</p>

<blockquote class="bluetext">
  <p>Chayot is pronounced here ‘Kay-oh’. Ish. It’s the name of a particular type of Angel, associated with fire. The difference between <abbr title="characters/samael">Samael</abbr>’s apprenticeship and those of the other two player characters is intended to showcase the differences between Orders and of <abbr title="characters/samael">Samael</abbr>’s personality versus the others - <abbr title="characters/cobalt">Cobalt</abbr> thinks of magic as a tool, and Persephone as an escape, but <abbr title="characters/samael">Samael</abbr> thinks of it as an Art, and Chris does a good job portraying <abbr title="characters/samael">Samael</abbr> thinking deeper about the implications of magic than the other two - his voice is more serious when he speaks about it, he’s careful in this session to portray <abbr title="characters/samael">Samael</abbr> as living according to the Mysterium’s principles. There’s a certain amount of guilt, there, too - which Chayot plays on, reminding <abbr title="characters/samael">Samael</abbr> of the need for focus - which will lead into the major theme of the Chronicle of the responsibility of power. I wanted to lay it on thick because, well… Chayot isn’t going to survive the prelude, and I wanted a strong enough character that, like Malakaii in Broken Diamond, he’ll colour the chronicle long after he’s gone.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The house was small when it was a farm cottage, but filled with books, papers and artefacts as it is it’s positively cramped. Chayot hardly ever goes outside, shuffling about with aid of a silver-topped cane that serves as his magical tool. At present, he’s at his desk, reading an old text.</p>

<p>There’s the sound of a car pulling up outside, and a knock at the door. <abbr title="characters/samael">Samael</abbr> glances at Chayot, who doesn’t appear to have noticed. Putting his eye to the spy hole, <abbr title="characters/samael">Samael</abbr> can see a thin-faced, red-haired man wearing a well-cut suit framed in the doorway, a silver-grey Bentley on the drive behind him.</p>

<p>“Who is it?” - Chayot</p>

<p><abbr title="characters/samael">Samael</abbr>, thinking, casts <i>Supernal Vision</i> and looks again. The stranger has a Mage armour spell up, and Mana in his pattern. <abbr title="characters/samael">Samael</abbr> is momentarily taken aback - he’s never encountered anyone who wears armouring spells when not expecting trouble, thinks about that for a moment, raises his own magical defences and then opens the door.</p>

<p>“Oh! I’m sorry. I was expecting someone else. This is Chayot’s house?” - Duma</p>

<p><abbr title="characters/samael">Samael</abbr> looks back at Chayot, who registers the newcomer with a brief look of shock rapidly covered with a polite smile.</p>

<p>“Duma. Unannounced as always” - Chayot, nodding at <abbr title="characters/samael">Samael</abbr></p>

<p>“Won’t you come in” - <abbr title="characters/samael">Samael</abbr>, taking Duma’s coat and going to make the tea.</p>

<p>.</p>

<p>“I like the place. Small. <i>Cosy</i>…” - Duma</p>

<p><abbr title="characters/samael">Samael</abbr>, watching from the kitchen and pretending not to watch, sees Chayot make a flickering signal with his fingers. Duma crooks a finger over his sternum, the other hand moving out of <abbr title="characters/samael">Samael</abbr>’s field of vision. Clearly, the newcomer is a Mystagogue - <abbr title="characters/samael">Samael</abbr> can recognise the hand signals of the Order, but not interpret them yet.</p>

<p>After a moment, he realises Duma is exaggerating his hand signals so that he can see them better.</p>

<p>“It serves” - Chayot</p>

<p>“For a hermitage.” - Duma, glancing at <abbr title="characters/samael">Samael</abbr></p>

<p>“My apprentice, <abbr title="characters/samael">Samael</abbr>” - Chayot, flatly</p>

<p>Duma shakes his hand, smiling pleasantly</p>

<p>“I thought you said you’d not train anyone else?” - Duma</p>

<p>“<abbr title="characters/samael">Samael</abbr> has great potential” - Chayot, in a warning tone of voice</p>

<p>“And an interesting Shadow Name. Mastigos?” - Duma</p>

<p>“Obrimos” - <abbr title="characters/samael">Samael</abbr></p>

<p>“…<i>Interesting</i>.” - Duma</p>

<p>Chayot glares at him, and he stops smiling.</p>

<p>“Why are you here, Duma?” - Chayot</p>

<p>“They’ve found out. The Cabal want it.” - Duma</p>

<p>“The Cabal no longer exist” - Chayot</p>

<p>“Nevertheless. Look - I’m here to <i>warn</i> you, old man. Out of respect. Will Quiet do the same? Porthos? Vahishta?” - Duma</p>

<blockquote class="bluetext">
  <p>What, indeed, will Porthos do? <img class="emoji" title=":grinning:" alt=":grinning:" src="https://github.githubassets.com/images/icons/emoji/unicode/1f600.png" height="20" width="20" /> That’s an old Mage: The Ascension revised joke for ya. These characters are named here to give <abbr title="characters/samael">Samael</abbr> the heads up should they appear later in the Chronicle.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>There is a tense silence</p>

<p>“Can I at least see it?” - Duma</p>

<p>Chayot considers, then makes a hand signal. They head upstairs to where Chayot keeps his small collection of magical artefacts. <abbr title="characters/samael">Samael</abbr>, figuring they’ll say if they don’t want him to tag along, tags along.</p>

<p>He’s quite surprised when “it” turns out to be the golden ankh on a long chain which Chayot has used to train him in the use of Mage Sight.</p>

<p>Duma stares long and hard at it, and <abbr title="characters/samael">Samael</abbr> feels the spell effects forming as the newcomer bombards the artefact with Unveiling and Knowing spells.</p>

<p>“You realise what this would mean to the work?” - Duma</p>

<p>“It is not available. It belongs to the Order, placed in my trust. That’s all there is.” - Chayot</p>

<p>The stranger nods, after a while.</p>

<p>“Well, then. I’ve come all this way” - Duma</p>

<p>“You should stay the night. Have dinner with us. It IS good to see you, old friend” - Chayot</p>

<p>.</p>

<p>“…So he’s in Peru.” - Duma</p>

<p>Dinner has proven enlightening to <abbr title="characters/samael">Samael</abbr>, who’s been shut up here in the remote corner of England for almost a year. Duma shares anecdotes of names <abbr title="characters/samael">Samael</abbr> has never heard, stories about acquaintances of his and Chayot’s. The sign that there is a greater magical society out there is alluring to the young Mage.</p>

<p>“And you? I doubt that car paid for itself” - Chayot</p>

<p>“I’ve spent some time in London, with Civitas. Advising him on a problem with a Legacy” - Duma</p>

<p>Chayot does not seem impressed by the name-dropping</p>

<p>“Civitas?” - <abbr title="characters/samael">Samael</abbr></p>

<p>“The Hierarch of London. Guardian of the Veil. I have known better Hierarchs, and worse - your own for instance” - Duma</p>

<p>“I haven’t been to Consilium” - <abbr title="characters/samael">Samael</abbr></p>

<p>“What? Not been down to Durham to worship Aurora like the rest of the Geordies? You’ve been hiding this one away, Chayot.” - Duma</p>

<blockquote class="bluetext">
  <p>Aurora is the Hierarch of the Durham consilium, into the territory of which the Tyne and Wear cities fall. Chayot lives further North than that, but the next nearest Consilium is in Edinburgh, so he’s a member of Durham’s Mysterium Caucus. There will be more about the Consilium next session.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>“<abbr title="characters/samael">Samael</abbr> is an excellent student. I didn’t want to distract him with petty politics” - Chayot</p>

<p>“…What is it you study, sir?” - <abbr title="characters/samael">Samael</abbr></p>

<p>“Ah! You’re an Obrimos, too, so you’ll understand. I study traces of the supernal world found in the Fallen Reality. My Legacy is based on the idea that the Angels are trying to send messages through, but they become obscured by the mundane. Magic occludes itself, as the Corpus Author says, and we try to find the hidden revelations.” - Duma</p>

<p>“You’re in a Legacy?” - <abbr title="characters/samael">Samael</abbr>, interested</p>

<p>Duma seems confused that he wouldn’t know, and looks at Chayot. Chayot makes a harsh hand sign, and Duma clams up, giving <abbr title="characters/samael">Samael</abbr> an apologetic look. The implication is clear, though.</p>

<p><i>Chayot</i> is in the Legacy, too.</p>

<p>“…I’ll make up your room” - <abbr title="characters/samael">Samael</abbr>, breaking the silence.</p>

<p>.</p>

<p>Duma watches him work from the doorway of the tiny guest bedroom.</p>

<p>“How long have you been here?” - Duma</p>

<p>“Just over ten months. I’m learning a lot” - <abbr title="characters/samael">Samael</abbr></p>

<p>“That’s criminally slow.” - Duma</p>

<p>“He’s very focused. And I need to dedicate the time to getting everything right. During my Awakening, I burnt down a church.” - <abbr title="characters/samael">Samael</abbr></p>

<p>“I sympathise. And I suppose restraint is a good thing to learn before you can set a man on fire with a thought. You’ll make a good member of your Cabal once you join one.” - Duma</p>

<p>“You and Chayot are in a Cabal together?” - <abbr title="characters/samael">Samael</abbr></p>

<p>“Were. It disbanded. We’re in the same Legacy, though… But I’m afraid I can’t tell you about that. He was quite clear” - Duma</p>

<p>“I saw you signalling” - <abbr title="characters/samael">Samael</abbr></p>

<p>“So you <em>are</em> studying for membership in the Order. Have you read the Corpus yet?” - Duma</p>

<blockquote class="bluetext">
  <p>The Corpus Mysterium is the Grimoire that describes the core doctrines of the Mysterium, penned centuries ago by an Archmaster known only as the ‘Corpus Author’.</p>

  <p>Soul Cage has a much greater focus on the Orders than Broken Diamond did, helped immeasurably by the fact that I have the Order books for the Mysterium and Free Council.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>“Only a learning text describing it. I’ve not had my initiation yet” - <abbr title="characters/samael">Samael</abbr></p>

<p>“Well. Not long off, by the sounds of it…” - Duma</p>

<p>He trails off, troubled</p>

<p>“When you said that They want it…” - <abbr title="characters/samael">Samael</abbr></p>

<p>“I tried to tell him, but your master is a stubborn old man. Please… Try to persuade him to at least hire a Banner Warden. And if, well.. If the worst happens, find me. I’ll do my best to help.” - Duma</p>

<p>“How can I find you?” - <abbr title="characters/samael">Samael</abbr></p>

<p>“Ask around the London Consilium. There are Mages in the Caucus that can get a message to me” - <abbr title="characters/samael">Samael</abbr></p>

<blockquote class="bluetext">
  <p>As you can see up-thread, Chris has immediately become suspicious. But no, Duma isn’t the guy who stole the Artefact. That would be too <i>simple</i>.</p>

<hr class="forum-break" />

<p><abbr title="characters/cobalt">Cobalt</abbr> and Cognos have driven up from Newcastle in Cognos’ Mini Metro, thus proving <abbr title="characters/cobalt">Cobalt</abbr>’s theory about the relative sizes of men and cars. They’ve discussed most of the relevant points over several pub sessions - the Supernal World, the Watchtowers, Arcana and Practices. Cognos has mentioned the Atlantean orthodoxy and the Orders from the highly-biased viewpoint of a Free Councillor, stating that he personally doesn’t believe in a literal magical island where Everything Was Better.</p>

<p>Cognos apparently lives in a Lighthouse.</p>

<p><abbr title="characters/cobalt">Cobalt</abbr> gets out of the car and looks around at the drizzling rain and the Northumbrian coast. The lighthouse is built up on a bluff, accessed by a road that’s barely a track.</p>

<p>“What do you think?” - Cognos, proudly</p>

<p>“A Wizard’s Tower?” - <abbr title="characters/cobalt">Cobalt</abbr>, dryly</p>

<p>“You’re more right than you know. Mana - I told you about Mana, remember? It sublimates into this world in High places, so Mages tend to live in skyscrapers, tall buildings, mountaintop retreats… Basically, Wizard’s Towers. I wanted a lighthouse for the symbology…” - Cognos</p>

<p>He is cut off by an arrow being loosed out of the window, over their heads and into a target set up on the grass.</p>

<p>“SEF!” - Cognos</p>

<p>Persephone sticks her head out of the window and apologises. She didn’t see them.</p>

<p>“This is <abbr title="characters/cobalt">Cobalt</abbr>! See?” (indicates <abbr title="characters/cobalt">Cobalt</abbr>) “<abbr title="characters/cobalt">Cobalt</abbr>. Come down and say hello!” - Cognos</p>

<p>She vanishes into the lighthouse again, and Cognos continues his explanation.</p>

<p>“It’s a beacon, you see? A tower, guiding the lost through darkness and chaos to safety; I wonder where they got <i>that</i> idea. I live in it because it’s proof - proof that humans can be and are influenced by the supernal every day, without any ‘Atlantean’ elements being involved at all.” - Cognos</p>

<p>“That was your apprentice?” - <abbr title="characters/cobalt">Cobalt</abbr></p>

<p>“Persephone. Wonderful gal. Acanthus Path. Keen Archer. And.. Of course… One day all of this will be hers” - Cognos</p>

<blockquote class="bluetext">
  <p>Welcome to <abbr title="characters/cobalt">Cobalt</abbr>’s hell.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>He gives <abbr title="characters/cobalt">Cobalt</abbr> an encouraging wink as he opens the front door. Persephone is coming down the stairs coiled around the internal space.</p>

<p>“Morning Sef” - Cognos</p>

<p>“Master” - Persephone, sarcastically</p>

<p>“This is <abbr title="characters/cobalt">Cobalt</abbr>… I already said that. It went well, obviously. Good thing you lent me those Potter books. <i>Just</i> the line. Can’t wait to read book six” - Cognos</p>

<p>Thinking about the death of the mentor figure, <abbr title="characters/cobalt">Cobalt</abbr> keeps a straight face.</p>

<p>“Sef, could you show <abbr title="characters/cobalt">Cobalt</abbr> around - show him his room and such? I’m off to Oblate.” - Cognos</p>

<p>He gives <abbr title="characters/cobalt">Cobalt</abbr> another encouraging wink and leaves the two of them to it, heading up the creaking stair to the Hallow in the lamp chamber.</p>

<p>.</p>

<p>“This is your room. This is my room - stay out. This is the kitchen.” - Persephone</p>

<p>The fridge has post-it-notes all over it, High Speech runes drawn on them in magic marker.</p>

<p>“That’s… One hell of a fridge” - <abbr title="characters/cobalt">Cobalt</abbr></p>

<blockquote class="bluetext">
  <p>It’s a fridge with a permanent Alter Efficiency cast upon it. The epitome of fridgeness.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><abbr title="characters/cobalt">Cobalt</abbr> hefts his travel bag and makes polite noises.</p>

<p>“So what are you, a professor or something?” - Persephone</p>

<p>“How old are you?” - <abbr title="characters/cobalt">Cobalt</abbr></p>

<p>“Eighteen” - Persephone, as though it were ancient.</p>

<p>I have students older than you, thinks <abbr title="characters/cobalt">Cobalt</abbr>.</p>

<p>“And you’re an… Acanthus? You went to where the Faeries are?” - <abbr title="characters/cobalt">Cobalt</abbr></p>

<p>“That’s right” - Persephone, clipped.</p>

<p>He nods and tries to think of something else to say.</p>

<p>“Want to come meet Sam?” - Persephone</p>

<p>“Sam?” - <abbr title="characters/cobalt">Cobalt</abbr></p>

<p>“He’s a Mystagogue - lives with his master in a house down the road.” - Persephone</p>

<p>She opens the front door and points out Chayot’s house in the distance</p>

<p>“That’s what, twenty minutes walk?” - <abbr title="characters/cobalt">Cobalt</abbr>, glancing upward</p>

<p>“Oh, he’ll be ages. We could take the car, if he left his keys around” - Persephone</p>

<p>She casts <i>Winds of Chance</i> and looks next to the coffee jar, plucking the keys from the worktop in triumph</p>

<p>“That was lucky” - <abbr title="characters/cobalt">Cobalt</abbr></p>

<p>“Wasn’t it?” - Persephone</p>

<blockquote class="bluetext">
  <p>If I were a Mage, I’d definitely try to learn at least Fate 1. It’s just so <i>useful</i>.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>…</p>

<p>One short car ride later, and they’re at Chayot’s house. <abbr title="characters/samael">Samael</abbr> opens the door, hearing them laughing at some joke. Probably at his Order’s expense.</p>

<p>Introductions are made.</p>

<p>“Sam, right?” - <abbr title="characters/cobalt">Cobalt</abbr></p>

<p>“That’s right. <abbr title="characters/samael">Samael</abbr>.” - <abbr title="characters/samael">Samael</abbr></p>

<p>He offers them drinks. Well, tea. Twice, until <abbr title="characters/cobalt">Cobalt</abbr> accepts.</p>

<p>“Why are you always offering people tea, Sam?” - Persephone</p>

<p>“It’s the second protocol.” (off their blank looks) “Right apprenticeship? I forget, sometimes. Cognos is a Libertine. It’s a Mysterium thing”</p>

<p>“So you believe in Atlantis?” - <abbr title="characters/cobalt">Cobalt</abbr>, with the air of someone told about that whole Atlantis think yesterday by a Libertine.</p>

<p>“Yes, technically. Look, the Mysterium aren’t just the Wings of the Dragon, yeah? I know Cognos lumps all the Diamond Orders in together but.. Say you go meet an Adamantine Arrow. Tell him he’s just a relic of the Atlantean warrior caste with no relevance to modern magic and count your teeth as you pick them up.” - <abbr title="characters/samael">Samael</abbr></p>

<p>“I’m getting the feeling Cognos was biased” - <abbr title="characters/cobalt">Cobalt</abbr></p>

<p>“Slightly. His heart’s in the right place, though. We in the Mysterium are about the study of magic as a living mystery, and there are rules and responsibilities. One of them is ‘Right Apprenticeship’, the agreement between a mentor and student. Basically, Chayot does right by me and I do right by him” - <abbr title="characters/samael">Samael</abbr></p>

<p>“By making the tea” - <abbr title="characters/cobalt">Cobalt</abbr></p>

<p>“By making the tea, and tidying the house, and studying hard on what he shows me. In return for which.” - <abbr title="characters/samael">Samael</abbr></p>

<p>He flicks his fingers, and the hob lights itself. He puts the old brass kettle onto the ring with a clunk.</p>

<p>“He’s teaching me how to meld the universe with my hands and set things on fire with my mind. In exchange… I make tea.” - <abbr title="characters/samael">Samael</abbr></p>

<p>“Cool” - <abbr title="characters/cobalt">Cobalt</abbr></p>

<p>He looks around at the books</p>

<p>“So are these all in..?” - <abbr title="characters/cobalt">Cobalt</abbr></p>

<p>“High Speech? No - just the spells. Here, like this one” - <abbr title="characters/samael">Samael</abbr></p>

<p>He shows <abbr title="characters/cobalt">Cobalt</abbr> a book containing the spiralling runes of magic.</p>

<p>At which point, Chayot limps into the room, leaning on his cane.</p>

<p>“Who’s this, then?” - Chayot</p>

<p>“Master - this is <abbr title="characters/cobalt">Cobalt</abbr>. Cognos’ new student” - <abbr title="characters/samael">Samael</abbr></p>

<p>“Ah. The diving accident?” - Chayot</p>

<p>“That’s right” - <abbr title="characters/cobalt">Cobalt</abbr>, slightly strained.</p>

<p>“My sympathies to you, then, being taught by that overbearing oaf. Still… Hopefully you can be a stabilising influence on that house of chaos.” - Chayot</p>

<p>“I’m not sure about that” - <abbr title="characters/cobalt">Cobalt</abbr></p>

<p>“What path, may I ask?” - Chayot</p>

<p>“Moros.. I think that’s the word” - <abbr title="characters/cobalt">Cobalt</abbr></p>

<p>“Ahhh.. All becomes clear” - Chayot, looking at Persephone, who shuffles awkwardly under the beady gaze.</p>

<p>No one appears to share in Chayot’s revelation.</p>

<p>“Of course. Libertines. I’m disappointed in you, though” - Chayot, to <abbr title="characters/samael">Samael</abbr></p>

<p>At which point, there’s a flash of light as space bends in the room to accommodate the sudden appearance of Cognos.</p>

<p>“Oho! Here you all are! Do you know, I couldn’t find my car” - Cognos, cheerful</p>

<p>“NOT! IN! THE! HOUSE!” - Chayot, nearly screaming.</p>

<p>Cognos looks briefly ashamed of himself. The two older mages begin to ‘banter’.</p>

<p>“Are you sure you’re up to the whole minute’s work of two students, Cognos? It might cut into your lunch hour” - Chayot</p>

<p>“Sef is just as capable as your boy. And one day soon <em>she’ll</em> graduate. Who’ll pick up after you when <abbr title="characters/samael">Samael</abbr>’s gone? Or were you planning on keeping him here forever?” - Cognos</p>

<p>“Don’t question my methods. My methods are handed down from my Order…” - Chayot</p>

<p>“And in Atlantis on the Moon they were used to train whole generations of Mages, yes. Look, old bean, I wanted to talk to you, anyway. I’m planning on taking the kids to Assembly next month, introduce them to the Order. If you want, <abbr title="characters/samael">Samael</abbr> could tag along” (off Chayot’s look) “Not to the Assembly, obviously, but the Consilium.” - Cognos</p>

<p><abbr title="characters/samael">Samael</abbr> perks up</p>

<p>“I’ll think about it” - Chayot</p>

<p><abbr title="characters/samael">Samael</abbr> is crushed</p>

<p>“Is.. Is everything all right, Chayot?” - Cognos, peering at him</p>

<p>“Fine” - Chayot</p>

<p>“I mean, if you need any help with anything, I AM only…” - Cognos</p>

<p>“I’m FINE. Perfectly fine, except for the constant trail of people through my home. OUT - and take your whelps with you.” - Chayot</p>

<p>The Mystagogue storms off into his office, leaving Cognos looking stunned.</p>

<p>“I’m sorry, he’s been distracted lately…” - <abbr title="characters/samael">Samael</abbr>, before Cognos waves the apology away</p>

<p>“He barely insulted me. Not like him… <abbr title="characters/samael">Samael</abbr>, the offer stands. And, er… Ask him if he needs any Tass, once he calms down. I know he’s hard up for it.” - Cognos</p>

<p>“Thank you, I will. Cognos… Can I ask you something?” (whispered) “Does the name Duma mean anything to you?” - <abbr title="characters/samael">Samael</abbr></p>

<p>“Duma. Duma. Duuuma. Duuuuuuuuuma. Dumaaaa. Duma.” - Cognos, at normal volume</p>

<p>“You bastard” - <abbr title="characters/samael">Samael</abbr>, whispered</p>

<p>“No, sorry. Never heard of him. Well, then. Come on, Kids” - Cognos</p>

<p>And the Libertine contingent leave. <abbr title="characters/samael">Samael</abbr> tentatively knocks on Chayot’s office door and enters.</p>

<p>Chayot - quite calm - looks up.</p>

<p>“Master, about Duma…” - <abbr title="characters/samael">Samael</abbr></p>

<p>“Later, <abbr title="characters/samael">Samael</abbr>, later. It’s in hand. If the worst comes to the worst, we can hire an Arrow. And I can’t give up the artefact. It’s not mine to give.” - Chayot</p>

<p>“Cognos is offering Tass” - <abbr title="characters/samael">Samael</abbr></p>

<p>“I wonder what it is he wants” - Chayot</p>

<p>“Maybe…” - <abbr title="characters/samael">Samael</abbr>, waving at the piles of books</p>

<p>“Yes. Probably. Especially with his new protégé” - Chayot</p>

<p>“Alright. I’m missing something.” - <abbr title="characters/samael">Samael</abbr></p>

<p>“Cognos isn’t qualified to teach a Moros - he’s a Mastigos. Pandemonium rejects the Matter Arcanum. And yet he went out of his way to get him, when there’s at least one Libertine on the University’s staff. No - if I’m to guess, I’d say he’s hoping <abbr title="characters/cobalt">Cobalt</abbr> will give his other student someone to confide in, and then tell those secrets to Cognos himself. How she Awakened, for instance. You know she’s never told anyone.” - Chayot.</p>

<p><abbr title="characters/samael">Samael</abbr> thinks about Persephone. The mythic figure.</p>

<p>“The King of the Dead. Right” - <abbr title="characters/samael">Samael</abbr>, mentally kicking himself.</p>
