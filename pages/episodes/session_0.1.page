# Prelude

## Session 0.1

> Welcome, faithful Reader! We made it to over 100 posts to the thread before the first session, which I think is pretty good going even for us. The carnival atmosphere must now stop, though, because we're in the serious business of.. Nah, the carnival atmosphere can go on.
>
> Some minor points of order and business - since the characters were statted, some more thoughts were expressed about Samael and Persephone's backgrounds and likely futures, mostly based on ruminating about their names (if she's Persephone, who's Hades? Why's Samael named after, well, the Devil?). The origin of Cobalt's name is actually quite cool.
>
> Anyways. The odd narrative device I have mentioned - the prelude is being done in a non-linear fashion. Each session is made up of a main scene or set of scenes with interspersed flashbacks - and the 'main scenes' are only in order within a session. Once we finish the prelude (it should take three sessions or so I reckon) you'll understand what's going on and will be able, should you so wish, to reassemble them into continuity order.
>
> This first game contains what would be the first half of the third session mixed with the first half of the first session as flashbacks. The second session will be made up of the first half of the second mixed with the second half of the first, and the last will be the second half of the third mixed with the second half of the second.

> This has one amusing side effect - the characters know what's going on here, but the *players* don't. "He" has stolen "It", but who He is and what It is weren't revealed until they were revealed in the course of play, which is why they're only referred to in dialogue in the very vaguest of terms. ![big-grin]

{:.bluetext}

It's 2.13 at night, and the train hurtles North to Oblivion.

Or Edinburgh, whichever is sooner.

In the rearmost carraige, within the large baggage compartment, the Cabal wrestle the train's window shut and - numb with cold and sporting bruises from the effort - take stock.

"He has to be here somewhere." - Samael

> We presume that the Cabal just somehow got onto the moving train after much effort - we'll probably get around to actually showing that scene in 0.3. The characters all had one or two levels of bashing damage from... Whatever it was they've just been through. Cobalt has a level of Lethal damage too.
{:.bluetext}

They get to their feet. 

Cobalt, the eldest of the trio, checks inside his jacket that the weapon he hastily grabbed is still there. Satisfied, he puts a hand to the metal medallion hanging around his neck (quite out of place with his outfit) and concentrates, casting <i>Dark Matter</i> to give himself the Mage Sight.

> Cobalt, in terms of looks, is more of an everyman than Samael. He's neatly hairstyled and, for this session, dressed practically in jeans, boots, a heavy shirt and a leather jacket. He's the most normal-looking, and we'll find out why in a little while - Cobalt has the most respectible "mortal" life, and not one he can just abandon. The medallion is his magical tool.
{:.bluetext}

Persephone pulls the clip off the long tube she's wearing slung over a shoulder and opens it, retrieving a bow and several arrows. She casts a Mage Sight of her own (Fate-based) while stringing it, and is careful to keep one arrow in particular easily to hand. Archimedies detaches himself from her other shoulder and drops to the floor, winding around her feet.

> Persephone's arrow is her magical tool. She's smaller than the men, with long brown hair and (from Agne's picture) somewhat elfin appearance. She's dressed in blouse, waistcoat and trousers. Archimedies is her familiar - a spirit possessing a thin, grey cat. We haven't yet learned what kind of Spirit he is.
{:.bluetext}

Samael shakes the rain out of his long coat and - not to be outdone - casts <i>Supernal Vision</i>.

> Samael's magical tool is a prism made of coloured glass, for reasons that will be explained during his Awakening.
{:.bluetext}

"Let's go" - Samael

And, coat swishing dramatically, he pulls the sliding door to the passenger compartment open.

> Samael has bleached blond hair, short, and a very dramatic coat. He's taller than Cobalt, better built and very defined in features - good cheekbones to have. He is categorically not played by James Masters. That he's appearing to be the Cabal's leader here is probably more due to Chris adapting quickly to the sudden start - in-character, this has reason to be Samael's show, too, although we won't learn that until later. Or earlier, depending on your outlook.
> 
> In addition to the spells they just cast, everyone has a Mage Armor up (Cobalt's is Matter, Persephone's Fate and Samael's Forces) while Samael also has a magic shield made of Prime on himself.
{:.bluetext}

---

The sound of the track shifts as the train goes over a bridge.
 
"So... Is he IN the train or ON the train?" - Persephone
 
"Let's assume in for now" - Cobalt
 
Samael spots something - the carraige is occupied. A few paces forward reveals a passenger slumped down in their seat, asleep with their head resting against the window.
 
Not that unusual on the red-eye.
 
The strange green glow around him, discernable to Samael's <i>Supernal Vision</i>, though, is.
 
> I'm trying to emphasise - no idea how good a job of it I'm doing - how odd Mage Sight spells are until you get used to them. The cabal are really new at this, so while I would have given more than "green", Samael's never experienced this kind of phenomena before.
{:.bluetext}
 
He reaches out and gives the passenger a tentative push. No reaction.
 
"Okay. That's weird" - Samael.

He looks around and - just to be certain - takes the safety information card from the back of the passenger's seat. The others give him a look.

"You never know" - Samael

"It's not that, it's just.. The card is Fated" - Persephone

She means it is registering faintly to her Mage Sight. So, for that matter, is the door.
 
---
 
Second carraige, and weird has turned to creepy. There are three passengers in this car, and they're all of them comatose. All registering with the same odd glow to Prime-sight. As far as Samael can tell, it's not a Supernal effect.
 
"Legacy? Or something else?" - Cobalt

"Fate is... Not saying anything useful" - Persephone
 
They try to open the door to car number three, but it won't slide - it appears to have been locked shut. After hefting it, with no success, Persephone and Samael step back.
 
"Okay. Cobalt, you're up" - Samael
 
---
 
"Dr Williams? We're ready for you" - Technician
 
<b>Three Months Ago.</b>
 
> And, with Samael's line we enter the first flashback - How Cobalt Awakened. The voices of the research students (not to mention their questions) were provided by Chris and Agena.
{:.bluetext}
 
Rex emerges onto the deck of the research vessel, somewhere off the coast of Scotland. Engineers are working on the crane mechanism and students - some with cameraphones, some trying to take notes - are regarding him attentively.
 
"Good morning. I hope you've all got your sea legs. I know you're all just here for a cruise, but in the vain hope that you might want to actually learn something, pay attention to this bit." - Rex
 
Hanging from the crane is a hardsuit diving shell - less a diving suit, more a one-man submarine with arms. Rex carefully climbs in, connecting everything up, continuing to lecture his class as he does so.
 
"Now, here in front of me we have three pressure sensors" - Rex
 
He indicates a large metal box with handles for holding it with the hardsuit's claws
 
"Two of which are sealed normally and the third sealed with the material we'll be testing which - if my theories are correct" (wry smile) "should withstand the pressure of the seabed far more. Now - we *could* do this in a pressure chamber, or by just lowering the test device down, but I find there is something to be said for practical experimentation." - Rex
 
He calls for questions as the lid of his suit is sealed on.
 
"Won't you get the bends?" - Student 1
 
"This suit is at one atmosphere inside, and will remain so" - Rex
 
"How deep are you going?" - Student 2
 
"Deep enough" - Rex
 
"What if a giant squid attacks?" - Student 3
 
"I'll try to direct it back to it's native waters. Failing that, the suit's onboard weapons should work" - Rex
 
"You Really have onboard weapons?" - Student 3
 
"No" - Rex
 
The winch activates, and he's hoisted into the air and swung out over the North Sea.
 
"And here we go" - Rex
 
He's lowered down, continuing to lecture as he goes, explaining the pressures the suit and test equipment are under. He's done the part about debunking science fiction fallacies and moved onto describing the pitch-black, well-below-freezing crush-you-flat-like-a-can environment he's descending through when he touches bottom.
 
"Now, as we can see from the gauges - and as you should be seeing on the monitor - the new seal is..." - Rex
 
There is a cracking sound.
 
The new material works just fine. Rex's suit, on the other hand...
 
...The sheer weight of black water all around him is suddenly very, very real.
 
"I... We have a problem here" - Rex
 
The pressure inside the suit slowly begins to rise as the second redundant layer cracks. Knowing it's futile, but unable to stop himself, he clamps one clawed hand over the crack. Far above, the dive engineers scramble to winch him back to the surface while students take photos on their phones. Over the radio, he can just about hear one of his students asking if he'll <i>im</i>plode or <i>ex</i>plode.
 
Surrounded by crushing weight, Rex begins to hyperventilate. And then blacks out.
 
> The suit breaks apart like an eggshell, falling away. Feeling the weight of the sea press him down, wondering how he hasn't been reduced to paste, Rex sinks - pushed downward by the tons of water. Down and down and down he goes.
> 
> He breaks the surface. Down has become up. Floating on the surface of a wide, perfectly still river of black water, he tries to draw a breath. The air is as solid as the water, slowly pooling in his lungs only with effort. The water is like swimming in liquid lead.
 > 
> With effort, he drags himself over and begins to try to swim, heading for what looks like a boat launch carved into the steep riverbank. Climbing the steps is agony, trying to push upward against the weight of air and the sucking pull of gravity.
 > 
> The ground is made of a uniform, dull grey metal - lead.
 > 
> There's a sturdy leaden arch at the top of the steps, carved with winding symbols he doesn't recognise. Beyond the arch is a road.
 > 
> Over the course of hours, one foot after the next, he sets off.
 > 
> Every now and again he sees a figure - he takes them for statues at first - dressed in lead clothes and apparantly unable to move. The Dead (and Rex somehow knows that they're The Dead) have lead coins rivitted over their eyes, carved with two of the symbols from the archway.
> 
> "I'd make a joke about Kansas, but I don't think the locals would laugh." - Rex
> 
> At one point, some distance from the road, he sees a village of the Dead - low, wide houses buckling under the weight of the air, inhabitants standing frozen in place.
 > 
> And then, after what seems like days of the exhausting progress, he sees something in defiance of the solidity of this place. A Tower, like an upside-down mace with a wide, heavily supported base and a thinner body. The doors stand open, but blocking the way are two of the Dead, metal clothing in the form of heavy robes. The gatekeepers hold their right hands out to him in a "halt" gesture - and there are the two runes again, carved into their flesh.
 > 
> "I'm coming in" - Rex
 > 
> The air grows even more solid between them - like walking through a concrete wall now. Veins standing out, with supreme effort he takes a step forward. The figures lower their hands and stand aside.
 > 
> Within the Tower, every surface is covered in the lead coins the Dead are wearing over their eyes. The runes are to the wall, though, revealing the undersides. At the ground floor they are marked with simple scratches but as Rex climbs, painfully, upward they transition into primitive writing and eventually to names. Words. Random symbols. Drawings.
 > 
> At the top of the long, winding stair is the room at the top of the Tower. A short stone (the first stone he's seen) altar, like a workbench, sits squat in the centre. On the altar is a hammer and nail, a blank lead coin and a shining diamond. The last is the size of Rex's fist, cut to an infinitesimal point at one end.
 > 
> Kneeling at the altar, Rex picks up the diamond and starts to scratch into the surface of the coin. Trying to sum up what brought him here.
 > 
> <b>Al8Ni18Co20Cu6TiFe47</b>
 > 
> The last work of a materials scientist. Slowly getting to his feet, he finds a blank spot on the wall and swings the hammer.
{:.italics}
 
The dive technician slaps him, and he wakes up.
 
"Dr Williams?" - Technician
 
Gasping for air that moves, camera-phone flashes going off in his eyes, Rex looks down past the removed helmet to where the suit cracked. It's flawless.
 
Somehow, he willed it to repair itself.
 
> The formula, Dave tells me, is roughly that of Alnico, a powerful magnetic material that was included in his new system. Note that it includes atoms of Cobalt - his Shadow name is a much-shortened version of the molecule. The spell he instinctivly cast was <i>Alter Integrity</i>, which feeds nicely into...
{:.bluetext}
 
---
 
Cobalt puts one hand to his medallion - a metal coin-like disk - and the other to the lock.
 
He casts <i>Alter Integrity</i>, willing the metal to degrade. He and Samael then - after a couple of goes - give the door a good shove, breaking the corroded remains of the lock and forcing it open.

---

The Cabal step into the third carraige and immediately know that something's wrong. Something's <i>off</i>, the odd prickly sensation of someone using magic nearby, but there is noone to be seen but another sleeping passenger. Who, Samael realises a split-second later, is glowing under <i>Supernal Vision</i> much more than the earlier ones. As though what happened to them is still in the process of happening.

He tells them this one's different. By Persephone's feet, Archimedies hisses, his fur standing up.

"Wait" - Persephone, stopping Samael in the process of going over to the passenger

She casts <i>Augery</i>, attempting to determine what will happen if he does so, and recieves a split-second vision, almost too fast to see, of the Cabal panicking and fighting. She can't see *what* they'd be fighting, though.

Cobalt drops his Mage Sight spells and casts a Knowing Practice spell of Death and Matter to detect weapons, but doesn't get anything - though the emergency hammers for windows could be used as such. Samael cautiously takes one.

> The spell works by detecting items intended to cause death - it doesn't work on improvised weapons (even a penknife), only things specifically designed to kill like swords and guns. I'll write it up after the recap.
{:.bluetext}

"Is it him?" - Samael

Persephone can't cast Augery on the same target twice in a day, so after some thought casts it on the carraige itself. This time, she gets a glimpse of something floating between them. She mentally asks Archimedies if there's a Spirit in the room. The familiar, in it's nonverbal fashion, says no and she repeats it.

"Not a *spirit*" - Cobalt

"But there could be something else in Twilight" - Samael

Cobalt casts <i>Grim Sight</i>, peering into the insubstantial.

"Uh..." - Cobalt

The ghost, trailing rags, hovers over Samael, unseen fingers reaching out for the Obrimos' throat.

---
{:.forum-break}

"Back off, buddy!" - Cobalt, to the Ghost

The Ghost materialises, shrieking. Persephone immediately nocks an arrow and looses... firing straight through it. She and Cobalt square off against it, trying to think of something they can do.

"Get the door!" - Samael

The Obrimos turns and raises a fist. The Ghost doesn't seem impressed.

A ball of crackling energy coelesces around Samael's hand, and he draws his arm back to throw it.

NOW the Ghost seems impressed.

> The Spell is <i>Celestial Fire</i>. Hold that image there - Samael in hero-pose, calling down the Aether. Time for another go on the wayback machine...
{:.bluetext}

Jeremiah pushes his long, dark fringe out of his eyes and digs in the debris covering his flat for the beeping alarm clock, then digs for his glasses. He dislodges a pizza box finding his battered duffle coat and fumbles the keys on his way out.

"I wish I had a cooler coat" - Jeremiah

<b>One Year Ago</b>

"We're glad to have found a glazier willing to take the job on" - Caretaker

He's in a church - small and shut down, dark and cold inside in defiance of the morning sunshine without. 

"It's the rose window, over there" - Caretaker

The circular stained glass window is the highlight of the church, installed on the east wall to light up the interior during morning services. And someone has put a brick through it.

Hence the services of Jeremiah, amataur art historian and glassblower, who is here to replace the damaged panes.

"Is there a stepladder or something I can use? I'll have to get up there" - Jeremiah

The caretaker nods and wheels the portable steps from behind the pulpit over.

"Oh! I think we have some cake left over. I'll leave it on the pew for you" - Caretaker

"Right. Thanks" - Jeremiah, producing his notebook out of his bag

The caretaker deposits the cake and then leaves him to it. He climbs up, opening the notebook and studying the window, figuring out what needs to go where, what exact colours to use and making eyeball measurements of the size of pieces.

Almost by habit, he starts to deconstruct what the window is about - these things tend to tell a story. It doesn't take him very long - the window depicts the whole of God's creation, from the seven heavens to Earth and then the Nine hells. Moreover, around the edge are symbols of the days of creation, starting at the top and working clockwise. 

He ponders the image of the universe with a great hole in it, and starts to mentally plug the gaps. Outside, the morning sun rises on it's arc, but he doesn't notice. The rest of the church seems to fade from his conciousness, until he has the odd sense that rather than being representative of reality, the window is reality. Everything else is just shadows, the setting for the jewel. The church is a lie. He is a lie. Even the cake is a lie.

> Chris resisted the urge to throw something at me at that line. I don't know how. ![wink]
{:.bluetext}

In a flash, he realises exactly what's missing. Before he can write it down, though, the sun moves behind the First Day and a beam of bright light flashes into his eyes. Stumbling, he slips and falls backward from the steps.

The window lights up completely.

He doesn't hit the ground.

> Jeremiah is consumed by the light, and all there is is light. He falls, surrounded by broiling energy. Noise - the sound of a furnace, of the sun, mixed with deeper sounds that he can only describe to himself as "the music of the spheres" - blasts from everywhere.
> 
> Eventually, he hits something and falls over, his glasses going flying from his face. He catches them, but the sheer heat is melting the metal frame and he drops one lens before desperately catching the other. It focuses the bright light all around into a thin beam ahead of it, and - thinking it must be important - Samael pockets it.
> 
> He's standing on a plane of energy - actually the same bright materia as the rest of this... place.. but flowing in a more orderly fashion. Not so much a solid surface as a current he can stand on. Uselessly shading his eyes, he adjusts to the optical illusion - the plane he's standing on stretches out ahead, but breaks up behind, refracting out into beams of energy.
> 
> There's a noise from "above", a call like nothing he's ever heard, and a great winged something, made of the same prima materia as everything else, flies overhead.
> 
> He is put in mind of Angels, living beings like wheels of fire.
> 
> "Follow the yellow brick road" - Jeremiah
> 
> Another of the beings does a barrel-roll around the "road" of fire he's on, corkscrewing around and around as it flies off in the direction he's headed. 
> 
> His heart pounds, nerves crackling with energy. The edges of his body are becoming indistinct, like he's being eroded by being here. He starts to jog, and then to run, faster and faster - never feeling tired. More of the beings fly on their strange dance over and around him, and he follows their trails as he runs, laughing. There is meaning in the way the angels fall, he thinks, but he can't glimpse what that meaning is. Every now and again he glimpses objects made of gold hanging in space, unmelted by the fires of creation all around them.
> 
> Then he sees it, jogging to a stop.
> 
> Hanging in "mid-air", a distance away from where his firey road runs right past it, is a Tower made of gold. The door is unguarded, but closed.
> 
> He steps up to the edge of the road and looks down. The fires extend as far as he can see, burning into his eyes. The Tower is unreachable.
> 
> Lifting one foot, he takes a step forward. then another, and another, climbing through nothing towards the Tower. The energies, seemingly random, form steps beneath his feet and flow away again when he steps off them.
> 
> Ascending to the doorway, he tries the golden doors. Locked, though covered in tiny, curling writing of some kind.
> 
> He raises the spectacle lens to his eye and - to his suprise - sees through the empty doorway into the Tower. Lowering the lens, the door is back.
> 
> The angels cry out.
> 
> Closing his other eye and holding the lens up so it fills his vision, he walks through the "open" doorway into the Tower. Inside, it seems made entirely of stained glass - shining with the light of the energies outside. Out of habit, he tries to trace what the pattern means, up and up to the top. It tells him things that Samael, in Awakening life, will never remember, no matter how hard he tries. Secret things. 
> 
> At the top of the tower, he steps onto a glass platform and sees the flaw in the design. A single pane is utterly black. On an altar made of gold are seven lanterns - gold-wire cages for spheres of coloured light.
> 
> He studies the arrangement, and notes that he needs a prism. He considers he might be supposed to pick a colour to complete the pattern, but decides to combine them into white light.
> 
> Crouching down, he holds the lens out. It catches the light from the lanterns and combines them.
> 
> The design completes.
{:.italics}

Jeremiah hits the ground with a heavy thump, his intact glasses in his hand and his mind full of fire and light. That fire spills out.

The stained glass window shatters in a thunderclap. The pews around him ignite, bibles burning with multicoloured flames.

In the fire, Jeremiah thinks he glimpses the movement of Angels.

---

Samael releases the ball of energy, which strikes the Ghost and knocks it, reeling, away from them.

Cobalt does his <i>Alter Integrity</i> trick again, and begins to prise the door open.

The Ghost, recovering, howls. With the sound of tearing metal, one of the carraige's seats rips itself loose and is thrown at Samael with all the telekinetic force the Ghost can muster. His magical armour flares, the Forces of Aether deflecting the missle at the last moment, but the corner of the chair housing whacks his head.

Cobalt and Persephone get the door open, and the trio flee into the next carraige.

That proves to be their mistake.

---

The passengers - still awake - in the fourth carraige look up at the commotion as the Mages enter, and then begin screaming as the Ghost gives chase. Cursing, Samael realises that he can't risk the Celestial Fire again, with Sleeper bystanders around. But the Ghost's powers are in no way affected by the Abyss.

"Fighting Retreat" - Cobalt

The Ghost, though, drifts from left to right, uprooting seats and shaking the floor. The lights flicker. The first person it reaches is a man in a Scotland shirt, empty cans of beer on the table in front of him. The ghost begins to rythmically slam the unfortunate rugby fan's head against the metal of the wall. 

"HEY! Leave him!" - Samael

Maybe he's just not as intimidating as Cobalt, but the Ghost certainly takes notice. The screaming Scotsman is hefted into the air and thrown - at speed - towards the Cabal, where he bounces off their Mage Armours. Persephone casts <i>Exceptional Luck</i> on the Cabal.

They retreat - Samael and Persephone dodging flying chairs and scotsmen while Cobalt unlocks the next door. He wrenches it open by himself and goes through first while the others try to follow, Samael throwing things through the ghost to keep it's attention on him rather than the bystanders.

It's quiet in the fifth and final carraige. Eerily quiet. The passengers are all slumped in their seats. Cobalt still has his <i>Grim Sight</i> active, though, and can see the fundamental difference between these and earlier - these passengers are dead.

Except one.

Cobalt swaps his Mage Sight spells for his weapon-detecting spell again, deliberately looking towards the far door, which would lead to the driver's cabin.  The knowledge unfolds in his mind - the living man, back to the aisle and huddled as though sleeping - has a gun.

Archimedies shoots through into the carraige, followed moments later by Persephone and Samael. .

Samael immediately notices, under <i>Supernal Vision</i>, that the man Cobalt is standing by has Mana in his Pattern and an Antimagic shield up. He and Cobalt nod, and Cobalt taps the Mage on the shoulder.

"Tickets, please..." - Cobalt

And then Cobalt punches him. The Mage drops his gun and, spitting blood, shouts something.

All the corpses open their eyes.

> You call this Archaeology? Initiative order goes Persephone, Samael, Cobalt, 'Him', the Ghost (currently a carraige away smacking Sleepers around) and then the just-activated Zombies.
> 
> Chris would llike to point out how impressive Cobalt punching someone in the face *through* Mage Armour is.
{:.bluetext}

Persephone holds her silver Arrow and casts <i>Bestow Exceptional Luck</i> again, smoothing Fate over the Cabal. 

Samael attempts to dispell the antimagic shield on their enemy, his control of Prime wrestling with the other Mages', but the dispellation fails. Cobalt, meanwhile, produces a large knife from his jacket and faces off with the zombies, slashing one in the arm to no noticeable effect.

"Guys..." - Cobalt

> The 9-again rolls were pretty wasted. Neither Dave nor Chris rolled a single 9.
{:.bluetext}

The mage gestures back toward the link to the previous carraige and shouts a word in the High Speech. There's a horrid noise as couplings break, and the back four carraiges detach themselves from the engine. Everyone stumbles in the sudden accelleration. 

> At which point, the players remembered High Speech.
{:.bluetext}

"Arrows!" - Cobalt

Persephone, still safe for the time being, sticks her remaining arrows into the foam of the nearest seat (except for one in her bow and her Magical Tool), casting <i>Superlative Luck</i> on herself. Samael flicks a cigarette lighter and - breathing High Speech into it - commands the flame to burst out, shooting thin lances of fire onto the nearest zombies. Cobalt hops back to stand with Persephone and casts <i>Armour Piercing</i> on the Arrow. The necromancer, seeing what's about to happen but unable to get past Samael to them, desperately tries to counter Cobalt's spell but *just* fails to stop it. A zombie tries to attack Cobalt, but his Mage Armour holds steady.

A pair of ghostly hands plunge out of the now-useless door to where the earlier carraige was and grip with freezing touch around Samael's throat.

Persephone looses her bow straight at the Moros. He tries to duck, but she shot low... and the Arrow goes right through his throat. His eyes bulge, surprised, and he falls to the floor.

> Cobalt's punch did a single level of bashing damage to him. Persephone's archery attack was, after taking into account the armour piercing, the dice pool bonus for the bow, spending a willpower, spending Destiny dice and the 8-again quality her earlier spell applied to the roll, *Eleven* successes, putting the Moros - who I'd carefully and lovingly statted - straight onto bleeding to death with 2 Lethal and 5 Aggravated wounds. *Ouch*.
{:.bluetext}

She stares at the corpse.

Samael chokes, trying to cast <i>Ephemeral Enchantment</i> on the remaining arrows or, failing that, Cobalt's knife so that they can 'kill' the ghost, but his spell fails. 

"Coob.." - Samael

Cobalt casts <i>Sculpt Ephemera</i>, peeling the Ghost's fingers back and releasing Samael. The ghost immediately responds by telekinetically throwing one of the the zombies at him. The remaining zombies attack Persephone and Samael, beating them with inhumanely strong fists - Samael to the point of near-unconciousness. Persephone and Cobalt try to fight back, shooting a zombie at point-blank range with an arrow and slashing at another with the knife, but they keep coming. Samael has a brainwave and, looking up at the enraged Ghost halfway through the door, slaps his hand onto the door casting <i>Ephemeral Enchantment</i>. As he casts, he feels the Abyss leaking into the spell - to Samael, it always feels like broken glass. Wincing, he absorbs the Paradox into himself.

The door suddenly becomes solid to objects in Twilight, and the Ghost is cut neatly in half, it's Corpus disintegrating into a mass of loose ectoplasm.

The trio stand off against the zombies, on their last legs but ready to go down fighting.

"Is there any way to get to him?" - Samael

That would be a no. The necromancer pumps blood out of his neck, his own zombies cutting the Cabal off from him.

"Damnit" - Samael

... At which point the necromancer finally expires and the zombies, bereft of the spells powering them, collapse into corpses.

Samael wobbles on his feet, but kneels by the dead mage, futily trying to see if there's anything to be done. He doesn't know much first aid, but he does know that when there's no pulse and the pool of blood is that big, he aint getting up again. Persephone watches him, uncomfortably aware that she made this happen. Cobalt, after a moment, bends and retrieves the necromancer's gun before hurrying - one backward glance at the corpse - through the carraige and into the drivers' cabin.

> Samael is on his last health dot, filled with bashing damage after the last round of combat with the zombies and the resistant bashing damage from the paradox. Cobalt and Persephone faced a Degeneration check for killing the Moros, and passed.

"Where are you going?" - Persephone

"Stopping the train!" - Cobalt

The driver is dead, which doesn't come as much of a surprise. Cobalt surveys the controls and figures that they're not that different from a boat, or a crane. That lever there must surely be the throttle... He eases it back and the train slows down, gently crusing to a halt.

Samael, going through the necromancer's pockets, finds what he's looking for. He stands up, holding a golden Ankh hanging by a long chain. 

"Got it" - Samael

"Is it all right?" - Persephone

She's never seen it under Mage Sight before - Samael has (in fact, he was taught to use <i>Supernal Vision</i> with it as an example) and can tell it's enchanted, but nothing else. Persephone can tell it has some kind of fate spell as a component, but the practice is beyond her.

Cobalt comes back through as Samael phones the Sentinel.

"Yeah. You can release Cognos - he didn't do it, and we can prove it. Yes, we have the artifact, and the thief. No, he's dead. Cleanup?" - Samael

He looks around the wrecked train, and considers the carraiges of traumatised - maybe even dead - Sleepers they abandoned further down the track.

"...Yeah. We're going to need cleanup" - Samael
